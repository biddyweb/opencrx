          openCRX Database Scripts for Oracle 8+

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes known problems and solutions with the openCRX
   database scripts for Oracle 8.

   upgrade-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: These scripts must 
   be executed to upgrade the database from <version-from> to <version-to>. 
   E.g. If you have a database of version 1.4.0 and you want to upgrade to
   version 1.6.0 you must run the scripts from-1.4.0-to-1.5.0, from-1.5.0-
   to-1.6.0.
  
   NOTE: the execution of the upgrade scripts is mandatory.
   
   migrate-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: The migrate scripts
   allow to migrate data from <version-from> to <version-to>. If you have
   made your own database extension you must add your own migration
   code. 
   
   NOTE: the execution of the migrate scripts is optional.


2/ Known Problems
   --------------
   
   Illegal Blank Lines
   -------------------
   Running the create and update scripts with Oracle Enterprise Manager
   blank lines will be marked as syntax errors. Solution a) use TOAD
   as SQL client b) remove manually the blank lines from the scripts.
   
   NCLOBs
   ------
   The tables kernel_AuditLogEntry, kernel_Note and others define colums
   of type NCLOB. Either The Jdbc driver seems to have difficulties with
   NCLOB columns. Data stored in these columns with more than about 1000
   characters is scrambled. For more info also see:
   * http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/htdocs/jdbc_readme101020.html
   * http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=536307&messageID=2592711
   Workaround: Define the column as CLOB. In this case, however, no UTF-8
   characters can be stored in notes, audit logs, ... anymore.
   If you know of any solution please let us know.
