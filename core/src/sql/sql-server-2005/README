          openCRX Database Scripts for SQL Server 2005

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes known problems and solutions with the openCRX
   database scripts for SQL Server 2000.

   upgrade-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: These scripts must 
   be executed to upgrade the database from <version-from> to <version-to>. 
   E.g. If you have a database of version 1.4.0 and you want to upgrade to
   version 1.6.0 you must run the scripts from-1.4.0-to-1.5.0, from-1.5.0-
   to-1.6.0.
  
   NOTE: the execution of the upgrade scripts is mandatory.
   
   migrate-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: The migrate scripts
   allow to migrate data from <version-from> to <version-to>. If you have
   made your own database extension you must add your own migration
   code. 
   
   NOTE: the execution of the migrate scripts is optional.


2/ Known Problems
   --------------
   
   Upgrade script fails: The index <index name> is dependent on column <col name>
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ALTER COLUMN commands fail sometimes if the alter command reduces the column
   size and and index exists on that column. In this case you must apply the
   changes manually with the Enterprise Manager.
