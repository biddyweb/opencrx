          openCRX Database Scripts for Oracle 8+

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes known problems and solutions with the openCRX
   database scripts for Oracle 8.

   upgrade-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: These scripts must 
   be executed to upgrade the database from <version-from> to <version-to>. 
   E.g. If you have a database of version 1.4.0 and you want to upgrade to
   version 1.6.0 you must run the scripts from-1.4.0-to-1.5.0, from-1.5.0-
   to-1.6.0.
  
   NOTE: the execution of the upgrade scripts is mandatory.
   
   migrate-from-<version-from>-to-<version-to>.sql: The migrate scripts
   allow to migrate data from <version-from> to <version-to>. If you have
   made your own database extension you must add your own migration
   code. 
   
   NOTE: the execution of the migrate scripts is optional.


2/ Known Problems
   --------------
   
   Illegal Blank Lines
   -------------------
   Running the create and update scripts with SQLPLUS or Oracle Enterprise 
   Manager blank lines will be marked as syntax errors. Solution 
   a) use Oracle SQL Developer or TOAD as SQL client 
   b) set sqlblanklines on   
   c) remove the blank lines

   Line too long
   -------------
   Running the create and update scripts with SQLPLUS or Oracle Enterprise 
   Manager blank lines which exceed the length of 2499 chars report an
   the error SP2-0027. Solution:
   a) use Oracle SQL Developer or TOAD as SQL client 
   b) split the lines   

   Reserved words
   --------------
   Avoid Oracle reserved words in column names (e.g. COMMENT, NUMBER etc.)
   * rename column name COMMENT to "COMMENT"
   * rename column name NUMBER to "NUMBER"
   * Set the type of column OOCKE1_VOTE.description to CLOB
