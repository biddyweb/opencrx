II. Configuration ICS
---------------------

Hint: It is recommended to create a calendar folder and a task folder for each
      openCRX remote calendar. Do not use your (personal) default calendar for
      remote calendar usage as you will loose all your appointments!

1) create a new calendar and/or task folder in Outlook (i.e. a folder that contains "Calendar Items")

2) add the following information to the description of this calendar folder

   url=< URL to access ICS calendar>
   user=< user >
   password=< password of user >

   for example:
   url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/opencrx-ical-CRX/ical?id=CRX/Standard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.ics
   user=guest
   password=opencrx

   Hint: to determine the appropriate URL, navigate to the desired
         activity group (tracker, category, milestone), activity
         filter or home page and start the wizard "Timeline";
         take the beginning of that URL up to resource=activities.
         and add "ics" to construct the URL to retrieve the ICS
         calendar.

         Example: ...andard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.html&user.locale=de_CH&user.tz=GMT%2B0100
         ICS URL: ...andard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.ics


II. Configuration VCF
---------------------

Hint: It is recommended to create a contact folder for each openCRX
      account filter. Do not use your (personal) default contacts
      folder as you will loose all your contacts!

1) create a new contacts in Outlook (i.e. a folder that contains "Contact Items")

2) add the following information to the description of this calendar folder

   url=< URL to access account filter>
   user=< user >
   password=< password of user >

   for example (assuming your account filter is named "allAccounts"):
   url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/opencrx-vcard-CRX/vcard?id=CRX/Standard/filter/allAccounts&resource=accounts.vcf
   user=guest
   password=opencrx


IV. Usage
----------

a) calendar

 1) click the button "CRX.getCalendars" to retrieve appointments and/or
    tasks from openCRX (the description of the calendar contains the time
    stamp of the last download - look for the line starting with "last_download")

 2) work with the calendar locally

 3) click the button "CRX.putCalendars" to upload appointments and/or
    tasks to openCRX (the description of the calendar contains the time
    stamp of the last upload - look for the line starting with "last_upload")

 Please note that there is no real synchronization. The latest change
 (based on time stamps) wins. Hence, make sure that your openCRX server
 and your computer running Outlook are properly time synched.

b) contacts

 1) click the button "CRX.getContacts" to retrieve contacts from openCRX
    (the description of the calendar contains the time stamp of the last
    download - look for the line starting with "last_download")
