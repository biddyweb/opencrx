      CR10008166: FormattedNoteDataBinding
      DataBinding which allows to format Title / Text of a Note. This allows to 
      improve the customizing of grids containing notes. The data binding 
      concatenates title and text of a Note to one string separated by a <br />.
      The title is set to bold. The title is filled up with &nbsp; according
      to the longest line of the text up to a maximum of 140 characters.
      
      Here is an example which shows how to configure the column 'formattedNote' 
      of an ActivityFollowUp:
      
      1. Configure a feature definition for formattedNote:
      
			<org.openmdx.ui1.StructuralFeatureDefinition qualifiedName="org:opencrx:kernel:activity1:ActivityFollowUp:formattedNote">
				<_object>
				  <type>org:w3c:string</type>
				  <multiplicity>0..1</multiplicity>
				  <changeable>false</changeable>
				</_object>
				<_content/>
				</org.openmdx.ui1.StructuralFeatureDefinition>
			</featureDefinition>							

      2. Configure an element definition for formattedNote:
      
			<org.openmdx.ui1.ElementDefinition name="org:opencrx:kernel:activity1:ActivityFollowUp:formattedNote">
				<_object>
					<active>true</active>

        --> there exists a relationship from A to B
      * distance == 2, accountFrom=B, accountTo=C
        --> there exists a relationship from A to B and B to C
      * etc.
      * distance == -1, accountFrom=B, accountTo=A
        --> there exists a relationship from B to A

      Search Wizard / ObjectFinder / IndexerServlet. The new (groovy based)
      root menu control provides a search input field which allows to perform
      keyword / index based search on objects stored in openCRX. The root menu
      is customized in ./core/src/data/org.opencrx/control/userwest. The control
      invokes the search wizard ./core/src/data/org.opencrx/wizards/en_US/Search.jsp
      which in turn takes the query string and creates a corresponding ObjectFinder
      on the user home and navigates to it. The object finder lists all index
      entries which match the query. Index entries are updates by the Indexer 
      servlet which is implemented as workflow and is controlled by the 
      WorkflowControllerServlet. The IndexerServlet indexes all objects which do 
      not have an IndexEntry which is newer than the modification date of the 
      object. The IndexerServlet creates an index by invoking the operation
      updateIndex() on the object to be indexed.

      * The feature name 'context:$uuid:object_class' corresponds to the feature name
        'object_class' with the context prefix context:$uuid. The value of the feature
        must be 'org:openmdx:compatibility:datastore1:QueryFilter'. The value is
        used by the database plugin and is used to trigger query filters.
      * The feature 'context:$uuid:clause' allows to specify the filter clause as
        SQL clause. The clause should be in ANSI SQL. This way the filter is database
        independent. E.g. use the ANSI SQL function CURRENT_TIMESTAMP to get the current
        date and not any DB-specific function.
      * $uuid must be replaced by any UUID, e.g. BP96MI-GEdu0Lr3K4tC9bQ.

      CR10006548
      Migrate application plugin to OperationAwarePlugin_1. As a consequence
      the plugin is split as follows:
      * the classes in package org.opencrx.kernel.backend contain the 
        business logic of openCRX
      * The classes in the packages org.opencrx.kernel.application.* contain
        the classes which dispatch operation requests to the backend classes
      * The compatibility plugin OpenCrxKernel_1 is still responsible for
        create, replace, get and find requests. However it does not handle 
        operation requests anymore. 
      To be done
      * Migrate the backend to jmi1/cci2. Get rid of DataproviderObjects.
      * Migrate OpenCrxKernel_1 to be fully OO. Instead of an
        OperationAwarePlugin_1 it should be a Plugin_1.
      
      CR10006543
      Migrate to cci2/jmi1 bindings. Migrate the openCRX APIs from the Java 1.4
      compliant cci binding to the Java 5 compliant jmi1/cci2 binding. Migration
      of client code (wizards, remote clients, reports, user-specific GUIs, ...)
      is straight forward. The wizards delivered in openCRX/Core and the
      openCRX/Store application show how to migrate to the new APIs.
      
      CR10006529
      Merge Web.ear and App.ear. Merge Web.ear and App.ear to one single EAR. 
      The merge a) improves performance (use of local refs) and b) simplifies 
      deployement.
      
      CR10006523
      JVM local ui repository. Migrate deployment to JVM local ui repository. 
      The ui provider is local to the ObjectInspectorServlet which has the 
      following advantages a) performance improvement, b) no conflicts in case 
      of multiple instances of ObjectInspectorServlet with different ui configurations.
      
      CR10006474
      activity1: calculation of actual effort. For performance reasons, the calculation 
      of ActivityGroup.actualEffort should be calculated by an operation instead by derived 
      attributes.
      
      CR10006414
      AccessControl: missing owner filter for extent queries. AccessControl 
      does now add owner filter property in case of extent queries.
      
      CR10006493

Version 1.11.0                                                      2006-08-26
==============================================================================

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR0003572
      Portal: Navigate to created object. The operation
        public RefObject_1_0 handleOperationResult(
            RefObject_1_0 target,
            String operationName,
            RefStruct params,
            RefStruct result
        ) throws ServiceException;
      of PortalExtension_1_0 allows to control the behaviour of the navigation
      after the execution of an operation. If an object is returned, a view
      is rendered and shown to the user. If null is returned the current view
      is shown, i.e. no navigation is performed. E.g. if an operation creates a
      new object and returns it as operation result this feature allows to
      navigate to a newly created object.

      CR10006351
      Portal: localized filters. Localize the auto-generated class filters.
      Locale-specific labels for customized filters are defined by setting
      the label property in the filter definition file, e.g.

      <void property="label">
        <array class="java.lang.String" length="5">
          <void index="0">
            <string>filter label for locale 0</string>
          </void>
          <void index="1">
            <string>filter label for locale 1</string>
          </void>
          <void index="2">
            <string>filter label for locale 2</string>
          </void>
          <void index="3">
            <string>filter label for locale 3</string>
          </void>
          <void index="4">
            <string>filter label for locale 4</string>
          </void>
        </array>
      </void>

      If no labels are specified, label 0 is set to the filter name.

      CR10006348
      IndexerServlet scans modified objects and update its index. The servlet is
      triggered periodically by the WorkflowController. Each run indexes at
      most one hundered objects. The set of objects to be indexed is determined by
      retrieving the audit entries not visited by IndexerServlet. This way
      the index is updated incrementally, i.e. only modified or newly created
      objects are indexed.

      CR10006350
      Portal: wizards and reports in operation menu. Allow to customize wizard
      and report definitions so that they appear as menu entries in the operations
      menu. Only non-customized wizards and reports should appear in the menu
      'Wizards' and 'Reports'.

      Wizards and reports can be customized as operations as follows:

      1. Add an OperationDefinition to the ui customizing files, e.g.

         <featureDefinition>
           <org.openmdx.ui1.OperationDefinition qualifiedName="org:opencrx:kernel:account1:Contact:showMaps">
             <_object>
               <isQuery>true</isQuery>
             </_object>
             <_content/>
           </org.openmdx.ui1.OperationDefinition>
         </featureDefinition>

      2. Set order tag in wizard or report definition to the fully qualified operation name, e.g.

         <meta name="order" content="org:opencrx:kernel:account1:Contact:showMaps">

      The operation org:opencrx:kernel:account1:Contact:showMaps can be customized
      the same way as a modeled operation.

      CR10006239
      Portal: height (125 pixels) and width (230 pixels) of the panels
      North and West should be customizable. PageEpilogControl offers the new public
      methods
      * setPanelSizeNorth(int newValue)
      * setPanelSizeWest(int newValue)
      which allow to set the panel sizes for the north and west pane. The panel
      sizes can be set in the layout JSPs, e.g. show-Default.jsp for the default
      layout.

      CR10006268
      address1: postalStreetNumber allows to store the street number as
      a separate field in addition to postalStreet where the street number
      is stored in formatted form.

      CR10006271
      Add query filter property. AccountQueryFilterProperty,
      ActivityQueryFilterProperty and ProductQueryFilterProperty added. Query
      filter properties allow to specify a SELECT clause which is forwarded
      to the database plugin and added to the WHERE clause as SELECT ...
      WHERE <query filter clause> AND <other criteria>. Here is an example
      for an account filter:

      Account query filter property:
      name:
        Accounts living or working in 'Z%'
      clause:
        object_id IN (SELECT acct.object_id FROM OOCKE1_ACCOUNT acct
        INNER JOIN OOCKE1_ADDRESS addr ON addr.p$$parent = acct.object_id
        WHERE addr.postal_city LIKE ?s0)
      stringParam:
        Z%

      The grid Accounts->Account Filters->Filtered Accounts returns all
      accounts matching the filter clause.

      CR10006248
      Add support for Jonas 4 (for more information see application server
      installation guides).

      CR10006259
      building1: add inventory item. Inventory items are items which have a
      location (in buildings) and may have relationships to other items
      and facilities.

2.    CHANGES

2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES

      CR10006319
      WfAction in ActivityProcessTransition
      ActivityProcessTransition allows to configure an error state (errState).
      The activity is set to the error state if the execution of any of the
      configured actions fails. In case of WfAction the following cases are
      handled:
      * Workflows.executeWorkflow() throws an exception
      * The workflow is configured with asynchronous=true. The execution of
        executeWorkflow() is always successful. In this case executeWorkflow()
        creates a WfProcessInstance entry as marker WorkflowHandlerServlet which
        executes the workflow at a later time.
      * The workflow is configured with asynchronous=false. The execution of
        executeWorkflow() is not successful if the execution throws an exception
        and maxRetries is set to 0.

      Transaction handling
      * Synchronous workflows are always executed in the context of the provider
        transaction. A synchronous workflow can never force a rollback. Exceptions
        are catched by Workflows.executeWorkflow() and the status is updated in
        WfProcessInstance and a corresponding log entry.
      * The implementation of a synchronous workflow must start a new transaction
        if it must be able to force a transaction rollback in case of an exception.
      * Asynchronous workflows are executed in the context of WorkflowHandlerServlet
        within a unit of work.

      CR10007235
      Wizard Loading: issue warning if meta tags missing / not found. Meta tags
      label, forClass, and order are vital for displaying the wizard in the
      appropriate operations menu; currently, if these tags are not found, the
      wizard is not loaded but NO WARNING is issued. The whole wizard file
      is scanned now for tags (instead of the first 10K only) and the forClass
      property is is logged after loading the wizard.

      CR10006345
      MailImporterServlet: improve error handling. Improve error handling of
      MailImporterServlet:
      * send alert to segment admin in case of errors
      * no low-level catching of exceptions with unexpected handling
      This way all exceptions are visible as alerts to the segment admin and logged
      at info level.

      CR10007321
      Disable subscriptions of disabled principals. disabled principals cannot
      login; if the subscription handler does not honour the disabled flag of
      principals, however, there is a potential security risk as the user might
      still receive e-mail notifications (which might contain information that
      should be available to enabled principals only...).

      CR10007458
      activity1: ActivityFollowUp is now a CrxObject.

      CR10007404
      account1: Group, UnspecifiedAccount, etc. should be subclass of AbstractGroup
      instead of Group. This allows filtering of accounts which are instance of
      Group only.


2.1.  FIXED BUGS

      CR10006373
      VCard, ICalendar: tagged attribute names. VCard and ICalendar importer are
      able to handle tagged attribute names, e.g.
      N;LANGUAGE=zh-cn;CHARSET=gb2312:Last name.

      CR10006316
      Portal: Media attachments with single quote in name broken. The file name
      in the download url is now url encoded. E.g. the file name Copy of crx_'pg.sql
      results in the download file name Copy+of+crx_%27pg.sql. The filename
      SOA_03_05.pdf remains unchanged.

      CR10007339
      Layout JSP of subclass is invoked. The layout JSP edit-<class B>.jsp
      is invoked when creating/editing class A objects where B is a subclass
      of A.
      With this version the layouts are loaded for class C with the priorities
      as follows:
      1. layout show/edit-<class C>.jsp if it exists
      2. layout show/edit-<class A>.jsp if it exists and C is a subclass of A
      3. layout show/edit-default.jsp

      CR10007421
      E-Mail Importer / various bugs
      * handle parts with disposition inline as body text
      * unnamed parts

      CR10007287
      Operation addWorkRecord fails if no resource is provided. No exception is
      thrown and no warning is generated, i.e. the user is led to believe that
      the work record was created (but it is clearly not as the DB is unchanged).

2.2   REMOVED FEATURES

      CR10006271
      The following classes are removed in model activity1:
      * ResourceNameFilterProperty
      * ResourceRoleFilterProperty
      * ResourceFilterProperty
      * ActivityGroupFilterProperty
      They are replaced by the more generic ActivityQueryFilterProperty


==============================================================================
Version 1.10.1                                                      2006-02-23
==============================================================================

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR10007457
      account1: list of addresses. Add shared association in account1
      SegmentContainsAddress which allows to get top-level access to all account
      addresses. This assocation allows raw access to address objects in contract
      to IndexEntry which is a (left) join of account and address objects.

      CR10007351
      DateProperty, DateTimeProperty: Add the property classes DateProperty and
      DateTimeProperty.

      CR10007350
      Data bindings for PropertySet. The following data binding classes for
      properties are available:

      * BooleanPropertyDataBinding
      * DecimalPropertyDataBinding
      * IntegerPropertyDataBinding
      * ReferencePropertyDataBinding
      * StringPropertyDataBinding

      The data bindings allow to add user-defined fields to CrxObjects as follows:
      1. Add the field as feature definition to the ui customizing
      2. Customize the new feature in ui customizing

      Below is a sample configuration which extends the class
      org:opencrx:kernel:account1:Contact by the new features custom1-5. You can
      add the XML snippet to contact.xml located in
      opencrx-core-CRX\WEB-INF\config\ui\Root\en_US. The values for the new
      features are stored as properties custom1, ... in the property set 'Custom'
      of the corresponding Contact object.

      Preparation for JDO. The database schema is now created using the JPOX
      support of openMDX. CopyDb allows to copy a database with 1.10.0 schema
      to a 'JDO compliant' database with 1.10.0+ schema. The database is accessed
      using the openMDX database plugin. A migration to a JPOX based database
      plugin is solved in a separate request. Schema creation is done as follows:
      * build openCRX with 'ant deliverables'
      * create schema with 'ant -Ddatabase.name="<db name>" create-schema
      <db name> is the name of a JPOX properties file located in ./core/etc/jpox.

      Portal: inline object references. Allow to customize inline object reference
      tags. I.e. the tag 'activity:<activity number>' embedded in a TextValue field
      should be translated to the corresponding select object action. Extend
      PortalExtension_1_0 by the method renderTextValue().

      CR10007127
      CrxObjects are AlertSender. UserHomes and CrxObjects implement the method
      sendAlert(). If invoked on a CrxObject the parameter reference may be left
      empty. The reference is then set to the CrxObject which the operation is
      invoked on.

      CR10007128
      addWorkRecord() on activities. Activities implement the method
      addWorkRecordByDuration(). The method adds a work record and creates a
      resource assignment for the resource if it does not exist.

      CR10007113
      Mantis importer wizard. Add wizard which allows to import bug tracking
      projects from a mantis database. The wizard is available on the activities
      segment and takes the following input parameters:

      * Mantis project name
        Name of the mantis project to be imported.
      * Bug category names:
        List of bug categories (default is 'documentation, bug, software bug,
        hardware bug, feature request, note, question, task, installation,
        application form'). The mantis bug categories are mapped to activity
        incident type.
      * File upload base dir:
        Specify the base directory where mantis has stored the upload files.
      * Jdbc driver class:
        The mantis database is accessed using the specified jdbc driver. Specify
        the driver class, e.g. com.mysql.jdbc.Driver for MySQL.
      * Jdbc connection URL:
        Specify the jdbc connection url for the mantis database,
        e.g. jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mantis.
      * Jdbc user:
        Specify the mantis user name.
      * Jdbc password:
        Specify the mantis user password.
      * Activity creator name:
        It is a good idea to prepare openCRX as follows:
        1) Create an activity group which matches the name of the Mantis
           project to be imported.
        2) Create an activity creator and add activity group created in step 1).
           Set the name to the Mantis project name to be imported. Set the
           'Bug and features tracking process' as activity process.
        Enter now the activity creator name specified in step 2)
      * Process transition name:
        The bug notes are appended to an activity using the operation doFollowUp().
        The operation requires as parameter a transition of the process specified
        by the activity creator. In case of the 'Bug and features tracking process'
        the transition 'Add Note' works best.

      * createInitialPrices: creates initial prices for a price level. The
        prices are set to 0. The prices can then be set using the editable
        grid.
      * removePrices: removes all prices from a price level.
      * calculatePrices: calculates / recalculates the prices for non-basic
        prices levels and optionally all dependent price levels. The prices
        are calculated according the the price modifiers defined for the
        price level.

      occurences of path values of the form ../segment/Standard/.. are replaced
      by ../segment/S/... Segment 'Root' is not replaced. The segment Root
      contains shared objects, e.g. Uoms, Codes, Users and the references
      to these shared objects must not be replaced.

      CR10006315
      createUser: login principal and subject are created on-demand if they

2.    CHANGES

2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES

      CR10006227
      Database: normalize database tables. Multi-valued attributes are stored
      in separate tables. E.g. the single-valued attributes of an account are
      stored in the table kernel_Account, the multi-valued attributes are
      stored in table kernel_Account_N. This simplifies the views and improves
      the performance. The new database schema also serves as preparation work
      for a migration to another persistency framework such as JDO/JPOX or JPA.
      The database migration from previous versions is done as follows:

      * Run upgrade-from-1.9.1-to-1.10.0.sql
      * Drop all views
      * Convert to the database from old schema to the new schema by running
        the CheckDb tool. Download and install the openCRX binaries, open a
        shell and switch to the directory opencrx/core. The parameters for
        CheckDb are database specific. E.g. for PostgreSQL the command is:

        ant
          -Ddb.jdbc.url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost/<database name>"
          -Ddb.jdbc.driver="org.postgresql.Driver"
          -Ddb.jdbc.driver.classpath="<driver location>/postgresql-8/lib/postgresql-8.1-407.jdbc3.jar"
          -Ddb.username="<db user name>"
          -Ddb.password="<db password>"
          convert-from-1_9_1-to-1_10_0

        Depending on the database size the conversion can take several minutes. The
        conversion runs in two phases:

        - Phase 0: conversion of object references from the rid/oid format to the
                   single-column id format
        - Phase 1: database normalization, i.e. transferring multi-valued attributes
                   to the .._N columns

        All issued commands are logged to the console. If a command fails it MUST
        be fixed before going to the next step. Typical errors are:

        - ALTER and DROP statements can not be issued because of existing
          constraints. Drop the constraints manually and restart CheckDb
        - Version mismatch: the database is not of version 1.9.1. Expected columns
          can not be found

      * Create views with dbcreate-views.sql
      * Create indexes with dbcreate-indexes.sql

      For more information see the upgrade instructions http://www.opencrx.org/faq.htm#191to1100

      CR10006294
      Attach accounts in a role-based fashion to products. The references
      AbstractProduct.supplier and AbstractProduct.competitor are removed.
      References to accounts are handled by the new class AccountAssignmentProduct
      which is composite to AbstractProduct. The type of the assignment can
      be defined with the code field AccountAssignementProduct.accountRole.

      IMPORTANT: the database upgrade script drops the columns
      kernel_Product.competitor and kernel_Product.supplier and does NOT
      migrate existing assignments to the table kernel_AccountAssignment. If
      the columns competitor and supplier contain data you must migrate the
      data before dropping the columns.

      CR10006300
      home1: Alert, UserHome are Auditees. Alerts and UserHomes are Auditees.
      This allows to track modifications on these objects. As a consequence
      the standard action of a topic should be SendAlert only (and not
      SendMailNotification anymore). The new topic 'Alert Modifications' is
      the only topic with action SendAlertNotification. Users subscribe to
      this topic if they want to receive alerts and for incoming alert an
      email notification. The segment administrator should migrate existing
      topics and subscriptions as follows:
      * remove the SendMailNotification action from all topics execpt the
        'Alert Modifications' topic
      * add a 'New Alerts' subscription with topic 'Alert Modifications' and
        event type 'Object creation' for users who wish to receive email
        notifications for incoming new alerts.

      CR10006299
      sendAlert() must be executed with segment administrator privileges.
      Otherwise sendAlert() requires update permissions for user home of
      receiving user.

      CR10006295
      Upgrade to BIRT 2.1.1. The new version supports XML datasources which
      allows a better integration with openCRX. BIRT reports can be registered
      in the Web-EAR under WEB-INF/config/report/<locale>. The following rules
      apply for report definitions:
      * The name of a report definition file is
        <fully qualified class name>-<report name>.rptdesign. The report is
        registered in the 'Reports' menu of the inspector rendering objects
        of the class <fully qualified class name>.
      * The report design version must be of version 3.2.6 (the version is set
        by the BIRT report designer).
      * The title of the report is mapped to the 'Reports' menu label. If
        not defined, the name of the report is shown as menu label.
      * The report must be based on an XML datasource (make sure to select the
        DTP XML Data Source!). During report design, the URL of the datasource
        can be set to any local XML file, e.g. c:/temp/reports/TopNCustomers.xml.
        During runtime the XML data must be supplied by a JSP. The JSP file name
        must be data-<fully qualified class name>-<report name>.jsp. The servlet
        must return as reply an XML stream with content type 'text/xml'.
        The structure of the XML must match the report definition.
      Also see examples in ./src/data/org.opencrx/report/en_US.

      Install the following BIRT packages for report design:
      * BIRT 2.1.1 and all requirements as described on
        from http://download.eclipse.org/birt/downloads
      * After installation you must upgrade to the latest stable build
        of Eclipse/Datatools (DTP), version 1.0. See
        http://www.eclipse.org/datatools/
        IMPORTANT: Make sure that you meet all installation requirememnts
        of DTP (e.g. Eclipse 3.2.1 SDK, EMF 2.2.1 and GEF 3.2.1). Remove
        old versions of datatools, emf, and gef in eclipse/plugins.
      After successful installation you should be able to open the sample
      reports located in ./src/data/org.opencrx/report/en_US.

      CR0003852
      AccessControl: the new option inherit security settings from parent
      (path patterns configured by the method
      AccessControl_1.getInheritFromParentTypes()) allows to configure path
      patterns of objects which inherit their security settings from the
      parent object. By default, the access levels are determined by the direct
      composite parent object. The option allows to skip composition levels.
      E.g.  AccessControl_1 is configured by default so that DeliveryInformation
      inherits the access level from the Contract and not ContractPosition
      which improves performance when reading contracts and their positions.

      CR0003845
      Account(s) involved in Activity. The view Account.assignedActivity now
      shows activities which have a contract reference and the contract has
      as customer the Account. Activities and Accounts can be linked with any
      type of account (often Leads).

      CR0003839
      ativity1: ActivityType.activityClass supports activity1 extensions.
      activityClassName allows to specify the activity's class name if
      activityClass==0.

         and WorkflowController
      2. WorkflowController reads the configuration for monitored URLs from the
         ComponentConfiguration. An empty ComponentConfiguration is created on
         the fly. It can be managed with the standard GUI by admin-Root in in
         segment admin1. Sample configuration properties are:
         o serverURL: http://localhost:8080/opencrx-core-CRX
         o WorkflowHandler.CRX.Standard.autostart: true
         o WorkflowHandler.CRX.Standard.pingrate: 1
         o SubscriptionHandler.CRX.Standard.pingrate: 1
         o SubscriptionHandler.CRX.Standard.autostart: true
         With this configuration the WorkflowControllerServlet pings the URLs
         o http://localhost:8080/opencrx-core-CRX/WorkflowHandler
         o http://localhost:8080/opencrx-core-CRX/SubscriptionHandler
         with a pingrate of 1 minute for the provider CRX and segment
         Standard. With autostart=true monitoring starts immediately at
         servlet init.

      Performance option for AccessControl. In order to determine the browseAccessLevel
      AccessControl has to read the parent object before accessing (get / find) an
      object. This is very inefficient especially when reading contracts, contract
      positions, product configurations. The new option allows to configure a
      browse|create|remove|AccessLevel for specific path patterns. On object
      updates, the access levels are set according to the config. On object retrievals,
      the levels are read from the config instead from the parent object. The set of
      inheritance path patterns is configured by modifying or overriding the method
      getInheritFromParentTypes().

      CR0003904
      SecurityContext.assertPrincipals() inefficient.

      CR0003851
      activityNumber, positionNumber as autonum columns. The autonum attributes
      Activity.activityNumber and ContractPosition.positionNumber are configured
      as autonum columns at database plugin level (see populate-preferences.sql).
      The autonum values are generated by SQL sequences. As a consequence
      the columns kernel_Segment.current_activity_number and current_position_number
      are removed. The start value of the sequences should be initialized with the
      value of current_activity_number and current_position_number, respectively.

      CR0003899
      Contract_1.calculateContractPosition inefficient:
      * each position is retrieved (get) at least two times for a contract. In fact
        one find request for all positions would be sufficient.
      * delivery information is retrieved every time even if quantityShipped and
        quantityBackOrdered is not in the fetch set.

      CR0003843
      MailImporterServlet: migrate to ComponentConfiguration. The MailImporterServlet
      manages its configuration in admin1:ComponentConfiguration (and not in
      Workflow configuration anymore). The configuration properties are of the
      form:
      * <provider>.<segment>.mailbox [.Default] INBOX
      * <provider>.<segment>.mailServiceName [.Default] /mail/provider/<provider name>
      * <provider>.<segment>.deleteImportedMessages [.Default] false
      The .Default properties are created on-the-fly the first time the
      MailImporterServlet reads the configuration for a specific <provider>/<segment>.
      mailServiceName must be configured as mail resource:

      1. Enable mail resource-ref in web.xml
         <resource-ref id="mail_opencrx_CRX">
           <res-ref-name>mail/provider/CRX</res-ref-name>
           <res-type>javax.mail.Session</res-type>
           <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
         </resource-ref>
      2. Enable mail resource-ref in application server specific web.xml. E.g.
         for jboss-web.xml
         <resource-ref>
           <res-ref-name>mail/provider/CRX</res-ref-name>
           <jndi-name>java:/mail/provider/CRX</jndi-name>
         </resource-ref>
      3. Add mail resource to application server. E.g. for JBoss add a
         mail-service.xml (also see ./opencrx/core/src/connector/jboss-3/mail-service.xml)

      CR0003842
      Audit: efficient query for non-visited entries. The current implementation
      requires a query 'FOR_ALL visitedBy NOT_IS_IN <visitorId>'. This returns
      all audit entries where visitorId is not set. The audit marks all new
      entries with <visitorId>:[- | <time stamp of visit>] where - is set for
      new entries. The query 'THERE_EXISTS visitedBy IS_IN <visitorId>:-' allows
      a much more efficient database query.

      CR0003841
      account1: LegalEntity is a Group. LegalEntity should be a subclass of
      Group instead of a direct subclass of Account. This allows to add
      group members to legal entities.

      CR0003597
      Outbound EMail is now configured as application server resource. The setup
      is as follows:
      * Configure one (or more) javax.mail.Session resources. The configuration
        is specific for an application server. You find sample configurations for
        - Tomcat in ../opencrx/core/src/connector/tomcat/opencrx-core-CRX.xml
        - Jboss in ../opencrx/core/src/connector/jboss-3/mail-service.xml
      * Add the Mail resource-ref to web.xml. You find a disabled configuration
        in ../opencrx/core/src/data/org.opencrx/WEB-INF/web.xml or in the
        standard opencrx-core-CRX-Web.ear#opencrx-core-CRX.war. Add the
        resource-ref also to the application server specific web.xml. For
        JBoss this is jboss-web.xml. For JBoss you find a disabled configuration
        in ../opencrx/core/src/ear/opencrx-core-CRX-web.ear/opencrx-core-CRX.war/WEB-INF/jboss-web.xml.
      * MailWorkflow tries to find EMail resources with the following JNDI names:
        1. java:comp/env/<EMailAccount.outgoingMailServiceName>
        2. java:comp/env/provider/<provider name>/segment/<segment name>
        3. java:comp/env/provider/<provider name>
      * You find more information about JavaMail configuration at:

      Audit: audit entry created with missing auditee? It seems that in certain
      situations audit entries are created where the corresponding operation on
      the auditee is not completed sucessfully. E.g. object creations are logged
      as audit entry but the auditee is not created. Object are now created before
      audit entry. This guarantees that audit entries are created only if the auditee
      exists independent of the database and transaction policy settings.

      MailImporterServlet: servlet is able to import EMails from a configurable

      WorkflowControllerServlet (login to .../WorkflowController and activate
      the MailImporterServlet for the provider/segment to be monitored). The
      servlet creates the following configuration data on-the-fly:
      * Add MailImporterServlet workflow with default configuration properties.
        The configuration must be adapted to your environment (mail server,
        account, passwort, ...)
      * Activity creator 'Default E-Mail Creator'
      * Activity group 'E-Mails'
      * Activity type 'E-Mails'
      * Activity process 'E-Mail process'
      The MailImporterServlet polls the configured email account for new
      mails. For each attachment of type MimeMessage is processed as
      follows:
      * Lookup of an activity creator which matches the mail's subject.
        If no corresponding activity creator is found the default creator
        'Default E-Mail Creator' is selected.
      * A new EMail activity is created using the selected activity creator.
      * The EMail activity is updated with the attachment's content, i.e.
        recipients, subject, body. The original mail header is attached
        as note to the created EMail activity.

      Products: rework pricing model. Prices can now be assigned to one
      or more price level. A price level provides operations to create
      new prices and to derive prices from existing price levels. The
      price assignment to a contract position is controlled by pricing
      rules. The pricing rule logic is controlled by a user-definable
      script. This allows easy customizing of the pricing algorithm.
      Samples for pricing algorithms are:
      - lowest price (standard pricing rule of openCRX)
      - tariff / discount code based pricing. The pricing algorithm
        derives the price level from attributes defined on the contract
        or contract positions.

      Slow operation execution. Executing an non-query operation invalidates
      the object manager and retries all objects. This is OK for user data
      objects, however the control objects (root objects, favorites, history)
      should not be refreshed. User data and control objects should be handled
      by different managers.

      omitting endDate/validTo of price information. As of openCRX v1.8.1 one
      must set the attribute endDate (customized as validTo) of price information
      otherwise price attributes "at higher levels" (e.g. Bundled Product,
      Product Bundles, Product Offering, Contract, ...) are left empty.
      Example:
      Define a product with a base price and leave Valid to (i.e. endDate)
      empty. Creating contract postions containing this product will never
      have price information even if "current date >= begin date" holds
      The semantic of omitting the end date should be that the price is valid
      at all dates >= begin date. If there are multiple prices satisfying
      "current date >= begin date" then the price with the largest begin
      date (still satisfying "current date >= begin date") must win.

      product1/contract1: price calculation. The following fields are added to
      the contract position, product offering, product bundle and bundled
      product:
      * minQuantity
      * maxQuantity
      * offsetQuantity
      * minMaxQuantityHandling
        0 - N/A
        1 - informational
        2 - strict
        3 - limit min..max quantity
      The quantity to calculate the position amount in case of
      minMaxQuantityHandling == 3 is

      priceQuantity =
        min(
          maxQuantity,
          max(
            minQuantity,
            quantity-offsetQuantity
          )
        )

      This feature allows to handle scale of discounts as follows:

         quantity         discount
      *      <100             0%
      *   100-200            10%
      *      >200            20%

      Solution 1
      ----------
      Create a product bundle containing three bundled products with the
      following min/max quantities:

                       offsetQuantity minQuantity maxQuantity  price
      * product 0%           0             0          100      P

      * product 20%        200             0          MAX      P-20%

      Solution 2
      ----------
      Create a product bundle containing three bundled products. The
      first is the product with the normal price, the second and third
      are 'discount products'.

                       offsetQuantity minQuantity maxQuantity  price

      Contract positions - support for additional price attributes. Example:
      heating oil is typically sold in litres (--> UOM = Litre), but pricing is
      quoted for units of 100 litres (--> UOM = 100 Litres). A contract positions
      allows to two set two units: position unit and price unit. The amount of
      a position is calculated as amount = quantity * unitScale * pricePerUnit,
      where unitScale = 1 / priceUnit.quantity and the position unit must be a
      base unit of the price unit (--> see uom1 model).

      CR0003402
      Clone, XmlExport: support wildcard (*) referenceFilter. With opencrx-1.7.0
      the user must explicitely name the references of the composite objects to be

      composite, non-derived references. Default matches to :*.

      CR0003437
      Inventory management. Allow to update inventory based on contract positions.
      The operation Contract:updateInventory() updates the depots defined by
      contract positions. A contract allows to define a depot for 'goods delivery',
      each contract position for 'goods issue' and 'goods return'. updateInventory()
      creates a corresponding compound booking.

      Security: single principal for multiple segments. For each segment (created
      as root with createAdministrator()) a corresponding realm is created. A
      user with login foo can get access to a segment by executing the operation
      createUser() of the corresponding segment. This adds the principal foo
      to the realms 'Default' (Login realm), 'Root' (access to shared data such
      as codes and unis of measurement) and '<segment>'. The user can switch
      to a segment via the select role drop down.

      CR0003426
      Security: Allow that any user can be segment administrator. If a user is

      product1, contract1: user-defineable attributes. Allow to add user-definable
      attribute definitions to products. The attributes values are defined at
      contract-position level. In the new model a contract position is a
      ProductDescriptor and a product is a ProductConfigurationDescriptor. The
      operations createPosition() and createProductOfferingPosition() copy

      CR0003400
      ObjectInspectorServlet: Allow to enable/disable default filter on grid
      init. The default filter is always active when initializing the grid.
      It is now possible to enable/disable the default filter and store the
      current state in the settings. This feature may be useful for
      'expensive' objects/grids, e.g. pipeline, user home, accounts.

      Searchable and sortable object titles. E.g. the column Activity (name)
      of the grid (filtered) Activities of an Activity Tracker cannot be
      searched or sorted. Filtering on attributes of referenced objects is
      implemented as follows:
      * On persistence-level add the columns of the referenced object as
        private columns p$$<attribute of referenced object>
        (e.g. p$$customer_name). This way they won't be returned in the reply.
      * Use the filter properties p$$<attribute of referenced object> for sorting
        and filtering.
      Evaluator_1_0 offers the new method getTitleAttribute() which returns
      the title attribute of given class.

      CR0003365
      Editable Grids. Grids (object containers) can be customized as inPlace
      editable. If customized as editable, the user can switch such a grid
      (which is being viewed on "show" mode") to "edit" mode (without server
      roundtrip). Once a grid is in edit mode it cannot be switched back to
      show mode without either committing/saving or discarding changes. The
      edit grid supports cloning of existing and creation of new empty rows.

      CR0003270
      depot1. New model allows to manage depot entities, depot contracts,
      depots, depot positions, booking periods, bookings and depot positions.
      Depot positions are the booking target, each booking is assigned to
      a compound booking. A booking is either a debit or a credit booking.
      The debit balance of a compound booking must be equal to the credit
      balance. The model is generic. It can be used to manage any kind
      of booking target:
      * Cash / Money / Points
      * Products
      * Component / Product relationships
      * etc.
      A compound booking has two states: pending and processed. When
      creating a new compound booking the state is set to pending. A
      compound booking is typically accepted by own or more users. The
      finalize operation puts the booking into state processed. Finalizing
      a booking is typically controlled and performed by an external
      workflow process.

      CR0003363
      Asynchronous workflows. Topic subscriptions which result in the
      execution of workflows were executed synchronously by the openCRX
      (application) plugin. As a new feature, workflows can be declared
      as asynchronous. The execution of asynchronous workflows is
      performed in two steps:

      * Creation of a WfProcessInstance object with startedOn==null.
        WfProcessInstance objects are created automatically by the openCRX
        application plugin on matching topic subscriptions. startedOn==null
        indicates that the process was not started yet.
      * WfExecutionClient is the standalone workflow executor running as
        openCRX client. The executor periodically scans for non-started
        workflows and executes them. After execution it sets startedOn to
        the execution date. It also increments the stepCounter in case of
        failure and success. If the stepCounter reaches the maxNumberOfRetries
        threshold the workflow is not executed.

      The WfExecutionClient can be started with the ant target 'ant
      WfExecutionClient'. The resource file opencrx/core/src/ear/
      opencrx-core-WfExecutionClient.ear/server.rar/META-INF/ra.xml
      allows to specify the openCRX server URL.

      NOTE: For each provider/segment combination a seperate WfExecutionClient
      must be started.

      CR0003286
      ActivityTrackers and Contracts implement the TemplateEnabled pattern
      (implement the interface org:opencrx:kernel:base:TemplateEnabled. A
      template enabled object offers the following features / operations:

      * The operation 'createObject' allows to to create a clone of the
        template. The attribute 'referenceFilter' of a template allows to
        specify exactly the dependent (composite and referenced) objects
        to be cloned. Here are some examples for reference filters:
        - ActivityTracker (clone referenced activities): trackerParticipant,
          trackerCategory, trackerMilestone, trackerActivityLink, replacement,
          chart, trackerActivityLink/:*/activity
        - ActivityTracker (do not clone activities): trackerParticipant,
          trackerCategory, trackerMilestone, trackerActivityLink, replacement,
          chart
        - Contract: position, replacement

      * The operation 'deleteObject' allows to remove an object created from
        a template including all dependent objects specified by the reference
        filter.

      * The operation 'applyReplacements' allows to apply replacement values
        on an object (and its dependent objects) created from a template. E.g.
        Replacement values can be considered as variables defined by a template.
        'applyReplacements' allows to run a search/replace on objects created
        from a template.

      CR0003118
      Settings: allow to store default filter in settings.

      CR0003080
      Workflows: add user-defineable workflows. This behaviour is implemented
      by extending the interface Evaluator_1_0 by the method isEnabled(element,
      refObj). The method determines in the context of object refObj whether the
      element is enabled / disabled.

      CR0003159
      Show last init time of data object manager.

      CR0003161
      exportXml: allow to specify transitive export closure.
      The referenceFilter 'note, address, reportsTo, reportsTo/:*/reportsTo,
      reportsTo/:*/reportsTo/:*/address, reportsTo/:*/reportsTo/:*/note' exports
      the following objects
      * the invoked object
      * notes of invoked object
      * addresses of invoked object
      * the reportsTo contact of the invoked object
      * the reportsTo contact of the reportsTo contact of the invoked object
      * addresses and notes of the reportsTo contact of the reportsTo contact of the
        invoked object

      The referenceFilter 'customer, salesRep, address, position, position/:*/product,
      position/:*/uom, position/:*/salesTaxType' applied on a contract exports:
      * contract
      * referenced customer
      * references salesRep
      * contained addresses
      * contained positions
      * products referenced by positions
      * uoms referenced by positions
      * sales tax types referenced by positions

      CR0003058
      Add activity tracker. This allows to manage and organize activities.

      CR0003169
      Refresh all views after reload. Only current view is refreshed. All other

      CR0003142
      EMail system account.
      * User must define a default EMail account with defined E-mail address.
      * Segment administrator must define an EMail account with qualifier
        SYSTEM and Outgoing Mail Server (SMTP) settings.
      SendMail takes the SYSTEM account, if outgoing and incoming mail server of
      default EMail account are empty and the SYSTEM account exists.

      CR0003093
      Modeling: CrxObjects are SubscriptionTargets.

      CR0003168
      Remove script tags. Remove Javascript from new posts (i.e. remove anything
      between <script>...</script> tags. New option httpEncoder allows to configure
      a class implementing HttpEncoder_1_0.

      CR0003167
      Email Address Munging.
      Bugzilla adds HTML obfuscation of email addresses to hide emails from bots,
      crawlers and spiders. bugzilla simply replaces the "@" with "&#64;" (e.g.
      bugs&#64;bengoodger.com). New option httpEncoder allows to configure a class
      implementing HttpEncoder_1_0.

      CR0003106
      Make principal separator configurable.
      The following steps are required to change the ID_SEPARATOR:
      * Specify the system property org.opencrx.kernel.generic.SecurityKeys.ID_SEPARATOR=<new separator>
      * Set initPrincipal in web.xml to admin<new separator>Root and
        loader<new separator><segment name>, respectively
      * Modify the qualifier of the admin-Root principal in
        ...\bootstrap\Root\102_security_realms.xml to admin<new separator>Root,
        i.e. modify the line '... org.opencrx.security.realm1.Principal name="admin-Root" ...'

      CR0003209
      Add support for WAS6.

      CR0003058
      Activity tracker added. activity1 extended by ActivityTracker which
      allows to track and manage activities the same way as known by bug
      and incident tracker tools.

      CR0003161
      exportXml: allow to specify transitive export closure. The exportXml
      operation takes two parameters:
      * referenceFilter: list of instance-level reference selectors, e.g.
      account, customer, customer/:*/address.
      * attributeFilter: list of name value pairs where key is a refernceFilter
      and value an XML exported, base64 encoded filter.

      Examples:
      The referenceFilter 'note, address, reportsTo, reportsTo/:*/reportsTo,
      reportsTo/:*/reportsTo/:*/address, reportsTo/:*/reportsTo/:*/note'
      exports the following objects
      * the invoked object
      * notes of invoked object
      * addresses of invoked object
      * the reportsTo contact of the invoked object
      * the reportsTo contact of the reportsTo contact of the invoked object
      * addresses and notes of the reportsTo contact of the reportsTo contact
        of the invoked object

      The referenceFilter 'customer, salesRep, address, position, position/:*/product,
      position/:*/uom, position/:*/salesTaxType' applied on a contract exports:
      * contract
      * referenced customer
      * references salesRep
      * contained addresses
      * contained positions
      * products referenced by positions
      * uoms referenced by positions
      * sales tax types referenced by positions

      The following additional element definition allows to specify a customized
      export contract operation based on the exportXml operation:

      <org.openmdx.ui1.AdditionalElementDefinition id="ExportQuote">
        <_object>
          <active>true</active>
          <toolTip>

          </forClass>
          <memberElementName>
            <_item>referenceFilter</_item>
          </memberElementName>
          <memberDefaultValue>
            <_item>customer, salesRep, address, position, position/:*/product, position/:*/uom, position/:*/salesTaxType</_item>
          </memberDefaultValue>
        </_object>
      </org.openmdx.ui1.AdditionalElementDefinition>

      CR0003164
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support binary streams. Support on-demand retrieval
      of binary streams, i.e. attributes modeled as <<stream>> a: org::w3c::binary.

      CR0003080
      Add context-sensitive element enabling/disabling. In addition to the
      modeled operations, the inspector shows status (context) specific
      operations (transitions). Example: 'Mark As Read' is only shown when
      the Object is not read. This behaviour can easily be implemented by
      extending the interface Evaluator_1_0 by the method isEnabled(element,
      refObj). The method determines in the context of object refObj whether
      the element is enabled / disabled.


      CR0003118
      ObjectInspectorServlet: allow to store default filter in settings. Add
      the new filter 'Default' and the new operation 'Set as default'. This
      allows to set a default filter per grid. The default filter settings
      are stored in user user settings.

      CR0002530
      Keep user settings between sessions. The user settings are stored
      in Java Properties syntax in the attribute UserHome.settings.

      CR0003116
      ObjectInspectorServlet: new option userHome. When specifying the option
      userHome, the user settings are loaded/stored in the feature 'settings'
      in Java property syntax.

      CR0003115
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support iconKey and ordering for user-defined
      filters.
      <void property="iconKey">
        <string>ABC.gif</string>
      </void>
      <void property="order">
        <array class="java.lang.Integer" length="1">
          <void index="0">
            <int>90</int>
          </void>
        </array>
      </void>

      CR0003114
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support ordering of class filters. Support
      inspector ordering for class filters.

      CR0003113
      Ui_1: support ordering of inspectors.
      <org.openmdx.ui1.ElementDefinition name="org:opencrx:kernel:account1:Contact">

      </org.openmdx.ui1.ElementDefinition>

      CR0003072
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support icon keys for code value entries. The
      servlet accepts the new optional feature iconKey for code value entries.
      Code attributes and cells in grids are rendered with the configured icon.

      CR0003071
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support for colored code value entries. The
      servlet accepts the new optional features color and backColor. Coded
      attributes and grid rows are rendered with the specified colors.

      CR0002292
      Ui_1: extend element definition by skipRow. For various layout configurations
      it would be nice to have a "field-placeholder" available to better control
      the layout rendering. For example, it is currently not possible to produce
      a layout as follows (top cell of 2nd column empty):

      +-----+-----+
      | fld1|[empty]|
      +-----+-----+
      | fld2| fld3|
      +-----+-----+

      CR0002851
      ObjectInspectorServlet: support for stated code value entries. The
      servlet accepts the new optional features validFrom and validTo
      for code value entries. Entries with current date outside
      [validFrom, validTo] are not shown in drop downs when editing objects.

      CR0003104
      Modeling: activity classes are of the same type. Activity classes
      EMailActivity, SmsActivity, MmsActivity, ... are subclass of the abstract

      * Administrators is member of Unspecified
      * Users is member of Unspecified
      * Unassigned is member of Users
      * Segment administrator is member of groups Administrators and Users

      CR0003117
      ObjectInspectorServlet: replace option lastViewedObject by new option
      accessHistory. Replace the options lastViewedObjectsReference,
      lastViewedObjectsClass and lastViewedObjectsExclude by accessHistoryReference,
      accessHistoryClass and accessHistoryExclude option, respectively.

      CR0003029
      Verify alerts delete algorithm triggered by HomePage Refresh. Refreshing
      a userhome deletes alerts in a very generous way (and it seems regardless
      of state, i.e. even NEW alerts are deleted). Only alerts with state=3 (Accepted)
      should be deleted.

      CR0003104
      Modeling: activity classes are of the same type. Activity classes
      EMailActivity, SmsActivity, MmsActivity, ... are subclass of the

      Lookup inspector with bad Javascript if token contains '.

      CR0003054
      Contract position - initial price per unit not committed.
      * Editing this position, changing the prices and then committing again
        is possible (and the correct values are kept).
      * At Sales Order (part of sales pipeline) when you create
      a position and assign a product (by the glases from the
      product list) there are a couple of problems with the
      current v.1.5 release.

      1. Enter a "Price per unit" and klick on Save. The
      price you just entered will not bestored. Do it again
      by editing the position, save it again and then the
      price will be listed.

      2. If the price you entered is lower then the base
      price you stored with the product, a discount to the
      base price shows up automatically. This is a very nice
      feature but it seem to work only sometimes.

      3. The inspector does not update the price information
      of positions on time. That means that after you entered
      positions with prices the inspector will not update the
      price information until you start to open the Sales
      Order from the Sales Order List again. This is of
      course confusing since you have no indication whether
      you made a mistake (forget to enter the price) and
      requires too many clicks.

      4. When you use the magnifying glas to point to an
      existing product that have a base price you expect the
      price to show up as List Price.

      CR0003017

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR0002923
      Make password encoding configurable. OpenCrxKernel_1 supports new option
      APPLICATION/passwordEncodingAlgorithm. Default is MD5.

      CR0002771
      Sample openCRX client. The client org.opencrx.demo.kernel.SimpleClient is
      a very simple client which shows how to implement an openCRX client
      using the openCRX programming API. The client consists of:
      * The class org.opencrx.demo.SimpleClient containing the client's main.
      * The client application deployment descriptors located in the directory
        src/ear/demo.opencrx-core-CRX-SimpleClient.ear. The client is a J2EE
        compliant application client which is configured in .../client.jar.
        It is launched using the openMDX client application launcher
        org.openmdx.kernel.application.client.Launch.
      * The ant target demo-SimpleClient located in build.xml.

      IMPORTANT:
      * The client expects that openCRX is up-and-running on localhost:8080.
      If openCRX is located on a different host/port you must adapt
      .../server.rar/META-INF/ra.xml.
      * The client connects with user Guest/Guest to the openCRX server. If
      you want to connect with a different user you must adapt
      .../server.rar/META-INF/ra.xml.

      The client can be used as template to write any kind of openCRX client:
      * Data importer/exporter
      * Report generator
      * Fat client GUI
      * Thirdparty adapter
      * ...

      CR0002978
      Create user 'loader-...'
      In addition to the segment admin user (admin-<segment>), the operation
      createAdministrator() creates the user loader-<segment>. loader-...
      is added for:
      * It is configured as initPrincipal (in web.xml). Data imports are
        performed as loader-... (instead admin-...)
      * The Notification_1 plugin ignores any subscriptions when receiving
        modification requests from the user loader-...

      CR0002486
      Email alerts. Add option to send email notifications on incoming alerts.
      Subscribing to the topic 'Alert Modifications' executes the workflow
      'SendMail'.

      CR0002968
      Add AssignedActivities and OpenActivities to UserHome and Account.

      CR0002955
      Add audit support. Each CrxObject has a new reference 'audit' which
      contains the audit trail of an object. The before image of an audit entry
      contains all attribute values of the original object, i.e. before it is
      modified. All Audit entries are physically added to segments (reference
      audit) stored in table kernel_AuditEntry. They are mapped to their
      corresponding auditees by Audit_1.

      CR0002935
      Add publish / subscribe functionality. workflow1:Topic allows to create
      topics which 'listen' to object path patterns and the events add, remove
      and update. The topic defines a workflow which is executed as action.
      With home1:Subscription users can subscribe to these preconfigured topics.
      The workflow is executed on behalf of the user.

      CR0002936
      Workflow configuration properties. Add workflow configuration properties
      to workflow definition. Extend Workflow_1_0 interface correspondingly.

      CR0002501
      UiUtility: option format=table|schema added.
      * table: existing merge format
      * schema: ui1.xsd compliant merge format
      The new format 'schema' allows to merge the language-specific ui files
      into one single XML file. This simplifies structural reorgs.

      CR0002960
      Add SendMail workflow. Add a workflow which is able to send email
      notifications.

      CR0002621
      The class "Activity" features an attribute "isBilled" - what is missing,
      however, is information
      - to whom (Account) it is billed (potentially a list of accounts with a
        distribution key, e.g. Account#1 20%, Account#2 80%)
      - "link" between the Activity and the corresponding Invoices
      The references 'contract' and 'invoice' are added to the class Activity.

      CR0002953
      XML: export object at most once.

      CR0002930
      Customize WAR/EAR: allow to configure external provider.
      <provider>-properties.xml supports the new options
          external.provider.enable.begin
          external.provider.enable.end
          external.provider.delegation.path
          external.provider.jndi.name.format1
          external.provider.jndi.name.format2
          extensions.library.files
          extensions.library.home
          extensions.library.name
          extensions.classes
      This allows to configure an external provider which can be accessed
      from the kernel provider. This allows workflows to access user-defined
      business-logic and data.

      IMPORTANT: This version of openCRX requires that the external provider
      is an openMDX based component. If an openMDX gateway is configured
      as external provider allows to integrate any number of openMDX based
      and non-openMDX based providers.

      Xml export of code values. The currently available XML exporter exports
      the code value only for code attributes.
      Example: <salutationCode>1</salutationCode>
      For the purpose of rendering support the the exported XML data it would be
      convenient to also have the corresponding texts (short and long) available.

      DatabaseLoginModule for JBoss. Principals, roles and credentials are
      stored in the tables security_Principal, security_Role and security_
      Credential. They can be accessed by a JBoss DatabaseLoginModule.
      Sample policy configuration can be found in src/connector/jboss-3.

      CR0002656
      Complete AccessControl_1 plugin. The plugin controls object access
      according to accessLevelBrowse, accessLevelUpdate, accessLevelDelete,
      owningUser, owningGroup and the users group membership. The semantics
      of the access levels is as follows:
      * private: only owner has permission to access object
      * basic: only owner and users which are member of owningGroups, all of
        their subgroups and the direct supergroups have permission to access
        the object.
      * deep: only owner and users which are member of owningGroups, all of
        their subgroups and the direct supergroups and all of their subgroups
        have permission to access the object.
      * global: all users have permission to access the object.

      The database script set-access-level.sql allows to initialize the
      access levels and owning users and groups of all objects.

      The user 'root' is renamed to 'admin-Root'.

      CR0002817
      Support for MySQL 4.1+. Restriction: SQL view SearchIndexEntry (join
      Address <-> Account) does not work.

      CR0002820
      Support for bootstrap data loading. ObjectInspectorServlet loads/stores
      codes before storing user-defined data. This is not desired when user-
      defined data must be loaded before loading the codes, e.g. security data
      in the openCRX root servlet.

      CreatePosition (Quote, SalesOrder) fails. CreatePosition fails even if
      defaultUom of product is set. However, also setting salesTaxType helps,
      i.e. if both defaultUom and salesTaxType of a product are defined, then the
      operation CreatePosition works fine and the position is created without
      exception.

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR0002811
      Add AuditLog. In addition to SysLog and AppLog add the new logger AuditLog.
      The logger can be used e.g. in Login.jsp in order to log successful/unsucessful
      login attempts.

      From opencrx-1.3.0 on the EARs contain log configurations for AppLog and AuditLog.
      They can be activated by renaming the -D option org.openmdx.log.config.filename
      to org.openmdx.log.config.filename.syslog (the SysLog properties do not override
      the application-specific properties). This generates the log files opencrx-CRX.AppLog.log,
      opencrx-CRX.AuditLog.log and server.shared.20041214.log.

      CR0002746
      Add WebSphere 5.x deployment descriptors.

      CR0002791
      Package HtmlGUI as EAR instead of WAR. WebSphere requires application-
      specific deployment descriptors (ibm-application...xmi) for proper security
      and library configuration.

      CR0002757
      Improved locale management:
      The restrictions
      (1) locale numbering in web.xml starting at 0 WITHOUT gaps
      (2) locale ids in web.xml must equal locale ids in locale.xml
      will cause renumbering/reloading of codes whenever with virtually every
      change (e.g. it's currently not possible to 'disable' a language by removing
      it from web.xml unless locale.xml is also adapted...).

      CR0002768
      [open] filter for pipeline items. even though it's possible to view open
      pipeline items assigned to oneself on 'my homepage' it would be nice to
      have a filter [open items] for each of the grids Leads, Opportunities,
      Quotes, Sales Orders, Invoices.

      CR0002748

      Operation parameter fields partly cleared in server reply.
      Scenario: creating many new openCRX users with the operation
      UserHomes:createUser:
      1) filling in all the operation parameters
      2) click [OK]
      3) even though "visually" all the operation parameter fields still seem
         populated at least the hidden references (lookup fields) are cleared in
         the server reply; hence, to complete another createUser operation
         successfully ALL lookup fields must be populated again (even though
         some of the values could be reused if the hidden values were still
         present)

      automatic completion of 'ratedBy' if new Rating is created. Assuming that
      in 80% of all cases a new rating should be assigned to the currently logged
      in user the field "ratedBy" should be completed automatically if it is left
      empty when creating a new rating (behaviour similar to the auto-fill of

      The toString() method of org.openmdx.application.gui.generic.servlet.

      exception, because the sql is generated with BigDecimal.toString(), with
      always has a point as decimal seperator. The Oracle driver uses the Locale
      and is expecting a comma as decimal separator. Now setInt(), setLong() and
      setBigDecimal() is used instead of setString().

2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES

      CR0002538
      Add locale fallback to ObjectInspectorServlet. Add locale fallback based
      on language instead of fully qualified locale string. The fallback
      algorithm works as follows:
      - Iterate all locales configured in web.xml starting from 0, i.e.
        locale[0], locale[1], ..
      - Try to load resources from locale i, i.e. config/code/<locale i>,
        config/ui/<locale i>, config/texts/<locale i>.
      - If no resources are found at locale i fallback to resources of
        locale j, where j = max(J), J = {0} + {j, locale[i].lang == locale[j].lang}.
      If e.g. the locales en_US, de_CH and de_DE are configured and no resources
      are available for de_DE then de_DE falls back to de_CH.

1.    NEW FEATURES

      Warning message if parsing of a string in (edited) reference fields

      name of a contact into the field 'Reports to' (instead of pasting the URL
      to that particular contact or using the lookup Inspector to locate the
      contact) - obviously, parsing the name does not yield an object id and
      hence the user's input is discarded when the edited contact is committed.
