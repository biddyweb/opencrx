0.    SUMMARY
      * Migration to openMDX 2 architecture
      * Improvements for work and expense record management
      * Bug fixes
            
      For more information see below and http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/2.5/new.htm


1.    NEW FEATURES
      
      CR10008468
      Final PrincipalGroups. Add flag to mark PrincipalGroups as final. Access 
      level deep does not calculate subgroups for final principal groups. isFinal
      can therefore be used to fine-control the behaviour of access level deep.

2.    CHANGES

2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES
      
      CR10008468
      Final PrincipalGroups. Add flag to mark PrincipalGroups as final. The access
      control plugin does not subgroups for final principal groups in case of
      accessLevelBrowse=access level deep. 
       
      CR10008467
      Work and Expense record. Extend existing work record so that expenses 
      can be stored as well. Wizard CreateWorkAndExpenseRecord which allows
      user-friendly management of work and expense records. 
            
      CR10007950
      Migrate application plugin to openMDX 2 architecture. Backend classes
      in package org.opencrx.kernel.backend are fully rewritten. The backend
      now uses the typed jmi1 openCRX API instead of the deprecated, generic 
      openMDX 1 RequestCollection/DataproviderObject API. A backend is now 
      organized as library. The methods can be used in wizards, portal 
      extensions, data bindings or backend extensions. beClass.getInstance(), 
      e.g. Accounts.getInstance() allows an easy-to-use lookup. The standard 
      backend classes can be overriden by user-defined implementations.
      This way the standard openCRX business-logic can easily be adapted and
      extended.
      
      A user-defined backend class can be added as follows:
      
      1. Write a class which extends one of the standard backend classes, 
      e.g. Accounts as follows:
      
      package com.mycompany.opencrx.backend;

      public class Accounts extends org.opencrx.kernel.backend.Accounts {

	    public static void register(
	    ) {
		    registerImpl(new com.mycompany.opencrx.backend.Accounts());
	    }
	
        protected Accounts(
        ) {
        }
        
        ...
      }

      2. Extend the standard Configuration class and register your backend 
      class as follows:

      package com.mycompany.opencrx.backend;
            
      public class Configuration extends org.opencrx.kernel.aop2.Configuration {

	    public Configuration(
        ) {
		   super();
		   com.mycompany.opencrx.backend.Accounts.register();
	    }
	
      }
              
      3. Register the configuration class in 
      src/ear/opencrx-core-CRX.ear/gateway.jar/META-INF/ejb-jar.xml. This can
      be done by adapting the entry configuration.class.name in the
      build.properties file.
      
      
      CR10008417
      Replace openMDX/Log by SLF4J / JDK Logger. The sub-project openMDX/Log is
      not used anymore by openCRX. Tomcat+OpenEJB can therefore be configured
      as follows:
      * Option -Dorg.openmdx.log.config.filename can be removed and corresponding
        log properties file can be removed
      * Update CATALINA_HOME/bin/tomcat-juli.jar from openmdx/jre-1.5/core/lib
      * Update CATALINA_HOME/lib/openmdx-base.jar from openmdx/jre-1.5/core/lib
      * Add slf4j-jdk14-1.5.6.jar to CATALINA_HOME/lib
      * Remove slf4j-openmdx1.jar from CATALINA_HOME/lib
      * Adapt log configuration in CATALINA_HOME/conf/logging.properties to your needs
      * Remove LogConsoleServlet from customized web.xml
            
2.1.  FIXED BUGS
      
      SF329844
      So I did a post with the following settings:  
      POST http://localhost:8080/opencrx-rest-CRX/org.opencrx.kernel.account1/provider/CRX/segment/Standard/account/7wmWgCjdEd6ri3Nu6Dapag/member 
      <?xml version="1.0"?> 
      <org.opencrx.kernel.account1.Member> 
        <name>MyName</name> 
        <account>xri://@openmdx*org.opencrx.kernel.account1/provider/CRX/segment/Standard/account/NI7XwEIBEd29BeMf4vj8cA</account> 
      </org.opencrx.kernel.account1.Member> 
      NI7XwEIBEd29BeMf4vj8cA should become a member of 7wmWgCjdEd6ri3Nu6Dapag. 
      Anyway, I get a server error, without using the account argument all is fine.      

2.2   REMOVED FEATURES
      none
