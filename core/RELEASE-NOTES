==============================================================================
Version 2.7.0                                                       2010-08-20
==============================================================================

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR10009455
      Contracts.updateContractState(). Add method updateContractState() to 
      Contracts. This allows a user-specific backend to override this method.
      
      CR10009412
      AirSync Client supported added. A user can create 0..n AirSyncClientProfiles.
      An AirSyncClientProfile allows to specify host url, email, user and password 
      of an AirSync-compliant server (e.g. MS Exchange). The Wizard 'Synchronize Folders' 
      performs a FolderSync and creates SyncFeeds for each of the retrieved folders. 
      Supported are folders of type Contact, Calendar, Tasks and Email. The wizard
      must be invoked each time a folder is added on the server. The user can then 
      assign activity groups and contact groups to SyncFeeds and then invoke the 
      wizard 'Synchronize Items'. The wizard performs a Sync, i.e. synchronizes items 
      stored on on the server with items stored in openCRX. WizardLauncher combined 
      with a tool such as curl allows to automate the sync process.   
      
      CR10009406
      Configurable user-agent for mobiles. The option mobileUserAgents for
      ObjectInspectorServlet in web.xml allows to configure a comma or 
      semi-colon separated list user agent patterns. The GUI will be launched 
      in mobile mode if the user-agent header contains (indexOf() >= 0) one of 
      the configured user agent patterns.  

      CR10009384
      EditDocument Wizard. Wizard which allows to edit the head revision of a 
      text document (contentMimeType.startsWith("text/")) and stores the updated 
      text as new head revision.

2.    CHANGES

2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES
      
      CR10009472
      WorkAndExpenseRecord is a CrxObject. WorkAndExpenseRecord inherits 
      from CrxObject.


2.1.  FIXED BUGS
      
      CR10009486
      SF3047805: MultivaluedFeaturePredicate's throw Exception when used.
      ActivityQuery.contract() should return MultivaluedFeaturePredicate. However, 
      from the model, an Activity's contract has a multiplicity of 1..0 somehow. Hence 
      Jmi1QueryInvocationHandler actually returns an OptionalFeaturePredicate via by 
      RefQuery_1.refGetPredicate(). This conflict results in a ClassCastException, see below.
      I've tried and debugged this with a couple more MultivaluedFeaturePredicate constraints, 
      but got the same result.

	  CR1000947
	  References / Lookups. Populating references with the GUI should be possible 
	  by entering an XRI into the appropriate field
	        
      CR10009463
      Turning off unneeded locales leads to NA's. Grid column labels are set 
      to NA if only one locale (locale[0]) is enabled in web.xml.
      
      CR10009400: Depots.refreshReport()
      Queries on shared associations DepotReportItemHasSimpleBooking and 
      DepotReportItemHasSingleBooking are not allowed while creating the report.
      

2.2   REMOVED FEATURES
      none
