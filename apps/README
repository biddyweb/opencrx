-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes how to setup the openCRX applications.
      

   Installation
   ------------
   The openCRX SDK installer installs all required source, ant and
   Eclipse build files.
             
   Deploy
   ------
   opencrx-apps-CRX.ear is located in the folder
   c:\pj\opencrx-2.4.0\jre-1.5\apps\deployment-unit. Deploy opencrx-apps-CRX.ear
   to the same application server / location where you have deployed openCRX/Core. 
   Restart the application server if necessary.
   
   NOTE: the openCRX Server installers deploys opencrx-apps-CRX.ear for you.


2/ openCRX/Store
   -------------
      
   The openCRX/Store is available at URL 
   http://localhost:8080/opencrx-store-CRX/Store.jsp. Adapt host and port to your
   environment. 
   
   The store is managed by the store administrator. The store administrator is
   responsible for createing product categories, manage products and prices and
   process open orders. The store administrator can be created as follows:
   
   1. Register a new user, e.g. storeadmin
   2. Login to openCRX using the standard GUI. Lookup the newly created account
      in the tab 'Accounts'. Open the tab Property Sets -> opencrx-store:Properties
      and edit the property 'UserType'. Change the value from 'Regular' to 'Administrator'.
   3. In the store GUI logout and login as storeadmin. Add categories and products
      as required.
   
   In order to work properly, openCRX/Store requires the configuration of a sales tax type.
   This is done as follows:
   1. Login to openCRX using the standard GUI
   2. Go to Products -> Sales Tax Type
   3. Create a new Sales Tax Type with name 'Sales Tax 8.5%'. Set the field 'Tax rate
      in %' to 8.5. 
      
   That's all. The store is now ready for use.
   
   All actions performed using the openCRX/Store GUI are mapped to the openCRX API, i.e.
   all persistent data managed by the store can be inspected using the standard openCRX
   GUI. The mapping is as follows:
   
   Store                    mapped to      openCRX
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   User                                    Account / Properties
   Product category                        Product classification
   Product                                 Product
   Product price                           BasePrice / PriceLevel
   Order                                   SalesOrder / SalesOrderPosition
   
   Configuration options
   ---------------------
   The store has the following configuration options. The options are set in the
   web.xml of opencrx-store-CRX-Web.ear.
   
   * root (default is provider/CRX/segment/Standard). The store operates on one 
     openCRX segment. By default it is the segment 'Standard'. Multiple instances of 
     the store can be deployed where each instance points to another segment. In 
     this case the value of root must be configured accordingly.
   * currencyCode (default is USD = 840). The store is a single-currency application.
     The actual currency can be configured by setting the option currencyCode.
   * salesTaxTypeName (default is 'Sales Tax 8.25%'). The store is a single-sales tax
     type application. The sales tax type to be used can be configured with the
     option salesTaxTypeName.
