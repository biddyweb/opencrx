Changes:

0.    SUMMARY
      
      * VCF servlet added.
      * CalDAV servlet removed. Replaced by ICalServlet.
      

1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR10007556
      VCF servlet. VCardServlet allows clients to GET/PUT files containing 
      a list of VCARDs. The URL pattern is:
            
      http://'host':'port'/opencrx-vcard-CRX/vcard?id='provider name'/'segment name'/filter/'account filter name'&resource=vcf
      
      Example:
      http://localhost:8080/opencrx-vcard-CRX/vcard?id=CRX/Standard/filter/MyAccounts&resource=accounts.vcf

      
2.    CHANGES  
     
2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES

      CR10007598
      Deprecate CalDAV servlet and replace by ICalServlet. The ICalServlet
      now allows to create activities. In order to enable activity creation
      the calendar must contain an event of the following form:
      
      BEGIN:VEVENT
      UID: qualifier of filter
      CLASS:PUBLIC
      DTSTART:19000101T000000Z
      DTEND:19000101T000000Z
      LAST-MODIFIED:19000101T000000Z
      DTSTAMP:19000101T000000Z
      SUMMARY: 'filterId'
      END:VEVENT
      
      Calendars queried with a GET request always contain this event guard as
      first event. If the event is missing on POST requests creation of new
      activities is disabled.

2.1.  FIXED BUGS
      none
