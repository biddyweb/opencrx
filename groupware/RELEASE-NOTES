1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR10006455
      Groupware: XWiki frontend. XWiki can be used as Wiki frontend for openCRX.
      org.opencrx.groupware.xwiki.spi.StoreImpl implements the XWiki document
      backend. XWiki pages are stored as openCRX documents. The following steps
      prepare an openCRX segment for XWiki:
      * Create a document folder named 'XWikiSpaces'
      * Create the user 'guest'. This is required to allow anonymous access
        for XWiki users.
      * In the database increase the size of the columns OOCKE1_PROPERTY.string_value 
        and OOCKE1_DOCUMENT.keywords to 4K.
      * Launch XWiki with the URL http://localhost:8080/opencrx-wiki-CRX
      * Login as superadmin. The preconfigured password is 'changeit'. It can be 
        configured in build.xml.      
      * Go to Administration > Import and create the page 'Import'.
      * Go to Administration 'Upload and Installation' and import 
        xwiki-enterprise-wiki-1.2-milestone-1.xar which can be obtained from 
        http://www.xwiki.org. This installs a default XWiki.
      * After successful import the panel 'Search' has to be modified. Put the
        page in edit mode and set the form action to
        <form action="/opencrx-wiki-CRX/bin/view/Main/WebSearch">
      
      CR10006501
      Groupware: IMAP adapter. The IMAP adapter allows to connect to openCRX 
      with a standard IMAP client. openCRX activity groups are mapped to IMAP 
      folders. The folders contain openCRX EMail activities. A folder is updatable 
      if an EMail activity creator is available for the activity group. The IMAP 
      adapter replaces the MailImporterServlet. The configuration can be customized 
      by setting the following properties in build.properties:
      
      * imap.listenPort=143
      
      
      CR10006500
      Groupware: ICS servlet. The ics servlet allows allows to access activities 
      in different formats: ics, xml, html. The URLs to access the activities
      of a specific activity group are as follows:
      
      ICS
      http://localhost:8080/opencrx-ical-CRX/ical?id=CRX/Standard/tracker/<name>&resource=activities.ics      
      HTML
      http://localhost:8080/opencrx-ical-CRX/ical?id=CRX/Standard/tracker/<name>&resource=activities.html
      XML
      http://localhost:8080/opencrx-ical-CRX/ical?id=CRX/Standard/tracker/<name>&resource=activities.xml
      
      
      CR10006456
      Groupware: LDAP service. The LDAP service is based on SUN's OpenDS
      implementation. The openCRX adapter is implemented as 
      org.opends.server.api.Backend. The LDAP service is started up by the
      OpenDsServlet in the method init(). The default configuration is
      located in ./src/data/org.opencrx.ldap/WEB-INF/config. The configuration
      can be customized by setting the following properties in build.properties:
      
        ldap.baseDN=dc=CRX,dc=opencrx,dc=org
        ldap.rootPassword=changeit
        ldap.listenPort=389
        ldap.listenPort.secure=636
        
      The OpenCrxBackend exposes the login principals and the contacts under
      the following DNs:
      * BaseDN for contacts:
        dc=accounts,dc=Standard,dc=CRX,dc=opencrx,dc=org
      * DN for login principal
        dc=<principal name>,dc=users,dc=CRX,dc=opencrx,dc=org
      This allows an LDAP client (e.g. Thunderbird or Outlook) to connect to
      the openCRX LDAP service and retrieve the contacts stored in openCRX.
      A typical client configuration looks like:
      * hostname: localhost
      * baseDN: dc=accounts,dc=Standard,dc=CRX,dc=opencrx,dc=org
      * portNumber: 389
      * bindDN: dc=<principal name>,dc=users,dc=CRX,dc=opencrx,dc=org
      The LDAP password is the same as the login password for the standard GUI.
      
      Contacts and their assigned addresses are mapped to LDAP object classes as follows:
      objectclass: top
      objectclass: person
      objectclass: organizationalPerson
      objectclass: inetOrgPerson
      objectclass: mozillaAddressBookEntry\
      givenName: givenName
      sn: sn
      cn: cn
      mail: businessMail
      telephoneNumber: businessPhone
      facsimileTelephoneNumber: businessFax
      mobile: businessMobile
      street: businessPostal.getPostalStreet().get(0)
      streetAddress: businessPostal.getPostalStreet().get(0)
      mozillaWorkStreet2: businessPostal.getPostalStreet().get(1)
      l: businessPostal.getPostalCity()
      postalCode: businessPostal.getPostalCode()
      st: businessPostal.getPostalState()
      c: businessPostalCountryName
      postalAddress: businessPostal.getPostalStreet().get(0)
      title: title
      personalTitle: title
      o: organization
      company: organization
      ou: department
      department: department
      mozillaWorkUrl: businessWeb
      mozillaHomeStreet: homePostal.getPostalStreet().get(0)
      mozillaHomeStreet2: homePostal.getPostalStreet().get(1)
      mozillaHomeLocalityName: homePostal.getPostalCity()
      mozillaHomePostalCode: homePostal.getPostalCode()
      mozillaHomeState: homePostal.getPostalState()
      mozillaHomeCountryName: homePostalCountryName
      homePhone: homePhone
      mozillaHomeUrl: homeWeb

      CR10006343
      CalDAV server. CalDAV server added to project. The server is based on
      the Bedework CalDAV implementation. The mapping iCal <-> openCRX is as 
      follows:
      * A calendar is mapped to an activity group, i.e. each activity group
        is a CalDAV calendar.
      * Each VEVENT is mapped to an activity
      * The corresponding ical is stored in the activiy's ical attribute.
      * The ical attribute can be initialized with the operation importItem.
        The import updates attributes name, description, scheduledStart,
        scheduledEnd, ... of the activity
      * The ical attribute is recalculated if the activity is modified or
        if the operation updatIcal() is invoked.
      
      After deployment of opencrx-groupware-CRX.ear a CalDAV client can connect 
      as follows:
      
      * Tracker
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/tracker/<activity tracker name>
      * Milestone
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/milestone/<milestone name>
      * Activity Category
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/category/<activity category name>
      
      openCRX allows to define activity filters at the level of activity groups. 
      Activity filters allow to define a subset of the activities contained in an
      activity group. These subsets can also be mapped as CalDAV calendars. In this
      case the connection URL looks as follows:
      
      * Filtered Tracker
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/tracker/<activity tracker name>/filter/<filter name>
      * Filtered Milestone
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/milestone/<milestone name>/filter/<filter name>
      * Filtered Activity Category
        http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/<provider name>/<segment name>/category/<activity category name>/filter/<filter name>
       
      Examples are:   
      http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/CRX/Standard/tracker/CRIXP.openCRX  
      http://host:port/opencrx-caldav-CRX/CRX/Standard/milestone/openCRX~1.12.0/filter/InProgress
