II. Configuration
-----------------

Hint: It is recommended to create a calendar folder for each remote calendar. Do
      not use your (personal) default calendar for remote calendar usage as you
      will loose all your appointments!

1) create a new calendar folder in Outlook (i.e. a folder that contains "Calendar Items")

2) add the following information to the description of this calendar folder

   url=< URL to access ICS calendar>
   user=< user >
   password=< password of user >

   for example:
   url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/opencrx-ical-CRX/ical?id=CRX/Standard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.ics
   user=admin-Standard
   password=adminSecret

   Hint: to determine the appropriate URL, navigate to the desired
         activity group (tracker, category, milestone), activity
         filter or home page and start the wizard "Timeline";
         take the beginning of that URL up to resource=activities.
         and add "ics" to construct the URL to retrieve the ICS
         calendar.

         Example: ...andard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.html&user.locale=de_CH&user.tz=GMT%2B0100
         ICS URL: ...andard/userhome/admin-Standard&resource=activities.ics


III. Usage
----------

1) click the button "ICS.getCalendars" to retrieve appointments from openCRX
   the description of the calendar contains the time stamp of the
   last download (look for the line starting with "last_download")

2) work with the calendar locally

3) click the button "ICS.putCalendars" to upload appointments to openCRX
   the description of the calendar contains the time stamp of the
   last upload (look for the line starting with "last_upload")

Please note that there is no real synchronization. The latest change
(based on time stamps) wins. Hence, make sure that your openCRX server
and your computer running Outlook are properly time synched.
