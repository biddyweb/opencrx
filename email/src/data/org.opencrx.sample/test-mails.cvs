Summary: missing create statement for tables

Initial Comment:
Hi,

I think you forget to add the create statements in your
dbcreate-tables.sql the following tables are not there:

kernel_AssignedActivity and kernel_AssignedContract

this is why i get an error when i try to delete or
clone an contact.

I add the following lines to the dbcreate-tables.sql
and now all works fine here


CREATE TABLE kernel_AssignedActivity (

even though these tables were deprecated (and therefore are 
not created by the dbcreate scripts) there are some SQL 
statements (mistakenly!) still referring to them

will be fixed with openCRX v1.6.1 to be released shortly

the workflow ""org.opencrx.kernel.workflow.SendMail"" can 
send a notification e-mail on any subscribed event, but this is 
probably not what you are looking for - at this time, however, 
there are no other implemented ways of sending e-mails, i.e. 
you would have to implement something on your own

Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3177398
By: kratib

I'm trying to add custom business logic to openCRX. One of the requirements
is to automatically assign an object to a specific user on object creation.
It seems that OpenCrxKernel_1::notifyPreStoreObject is not called when an operation
like createOpportunity is called. Is that really the case? Is there a way to
hook on createOpportunity other than modifying the Contracts::createOpportunity
or OpenCrxKernel_1::operation itself?

TIA,
K.

Is it possible to express all linked/related tasks in a ""outline"" way at present,
that is just like the Gantte diagram?
If not, it will be planned to the recent roadmap?
Even though opencrx already supports ""Activity link"", but a ""outline"" mode view
could bring orgnized feel and proffesional to one folk in a project.

In fact, I've noticed a strange behaviour that apparently contradicts the code
in Contracts::createOpportunity. The code says to assignToMe if the salesRep
is empty. I created a lead and set its salesRep to null, then invoked the
createOpportunity operation: the salesRep was still empty. I can't figure it
out.

How can I customize the error message that appears to the user when I throw
a ServiceException in verifyObject? Right now a stock string is generated instead
of the developer-defined string - e.g. ""A contact's last name must not be '##demo
for user defined error##'"".

"[opencrx - Developers] RE: Developing with Eclipse + Poseidon","
Read and respond to this message at:

By: kratib

You'll find the Poseidon model
in opencrx-1.6.0/source-archive/core/opencrx-core.poseidon-model.tar.gz. Unpack
it to opencrx-1.6.0/core/src/model/poseidon. You'll find the models.xmi file
that Poseidon can open. After editing you will need to export back to .xmi -
since Poseidon saves to .zuml.

To use it instead of the Rose model, edit the file
opencrx-1.6.0/opt/openmdx-1.9.0/ant/etc/ant/build-properties.xml and modify
the property called ""model.transformation.source"" to ""poseidon"".

I've been modifying the Poseidon model for an OpenCRX customization job with
no problems. So far I've only added attributes to existing entities, as opposed
to adding new entities.

Hope this helps,
K.

even though these tables were deprecated (and therefore are 
not created by the dbcreate scripts) there are some SQL 
statements (mistakenly!) still referring to them

will be fixed with openCRX v1.6.1 to be released shortly

Summary: Session cookie - IE 6

Initial Comment:
I have noticed that on Win XP - sp2, together with IE
6, you are unable to login by domain name.  - ""Warning:
Browser must accept session cookies"". No session
cookies seems to be set.

However, as soon as you change it to the IP address of
the server, you are able to login fine.

Im not to sure if this is an openCRX bug or a micrsoft
issue.

Hi there,


Sales people of my company travels a lot along the country so I need them to
access opencrx from non-secure conections (as hot spots, internet kiosks, etc.),
the question is : What security issues should I have to consider in order to
deploy opencrx on internet?


Thanks,

Miguel

ok, already answered in other thread. 
Now, about DB scripts. I understand that the UML model is not intended to tell,
but is there any plans (or ways) to add that information? Like with xdoclets
and those kind of metadata tags.

Initial Comment:
Hello,

I add this message to the numerous I have already read 
on this subject.

The initial setup and launching of OpenCRX is not easy 
at all. It appears a lot of people have the same problem.
It may have a common cause, so a solution may be 
also common and shared between those people.  

I have installed the OpenCRX package as it is described 
in the documentation, I find good and clear enough.

The Jboss server is running. I do not see any error (but I 
can't confirm there aren't any error because I do not 
know how to detect error...).

I get the root login page. I enter the root creditentials for 
login. On the server, the Jboss window say a lot of thing 
(75,2 Mo log size after 10 min), and nothing happends 
on the client browser.

So, what's next ?
How to diagnose any problem ?
Is my setup good ?
Maybe a final setup test could confirm the good 
installation and help in diagnose bad setup... Is there 
any somewhere ?

Here is my system :
Windows XP SP 2
J2SDK 1.4.2
MySQL 4.1
MySQL Connector J 3.0.16
JBoss 4.0.2
OpenMDX 1.9.0

Best regards.

Arthur.

By: mediocre1

Hi,

I just installed openCRX 1.6.1 and now I'm trying to create users.

I read the Security Guide and the Quick Start Guide but I still don't understand
the link between a principal and a user.
I've created a principal ""foobar"" who is member in the principal group Users.
Now I added two contacts ""test1"" and ""test2"" and tried to create two users both
with the principal ""foobar"" and the first with contact ""test1"" and the second
with contact ""test2"".
The User Homepage for test1 was created but when I create the user for test2
it creates the User Homepage for test1 again. And when trying to login with
""foobar"" I can only login with the password given to test2.

So do I have to create for every user a principal? And isn't it contrary to
the content of the Security Guide?
Is there a guide how to create more than one user (like in Quick Start Guide)?

Thanks for reply
greets Marc

stop JBoss, clean all the temp/work directories and delete 
the log files, and then restart JBoss and connect/login to the 
root provider

look at the first few exceptions of your log file to get an 
indication of what could go wrong, but most likely - because 
of the large size of your log file - the connection to your DB is 
not configured correctly

Summary: Initial login and setup problem

Initial Comment:
Hello,

I add this message to the numerous I have already read 
on this subject.

The initial setup and launching of OpenCRX is not easy 
at all. It appears a lot of people have the same problem.
It may have a common cause, so a solution may be 
also common and shared between those people.  

I have installed the OpenCRX package as it is described 
in the documentation, I find good and clear enough.

The Jboss server is running. I do not see any error (but I 
can't confirm there aren't any error because I do not 
know how to detect error...).

I get the root login page. I enter the root creditentials for 
login. On the server, the Jboss window say a lot of thing 
(75,2 Mo log size after 10 min), and nothing happends 
on the client browser.

So, what's next ?
How to diagnose any problem ?
Is my setup good ?
Maybe a final setup test could confirm the good 
installation and help in diagnose bad setup... Is there 
any somewhere ?

Here is my system :
Windows XP SP 2
J2SDK 1.4.2
MySQL 4.1
MySQL Connector J 3.0.16
JBoss 4.0.2
OpenMDX 1.9.0

Best regards.

Arthur.

stop JBoss, clean all the temp/work directories and delete 
the log files, and then restart JBoss and connect/login to the 
root provider

look at the first few exceptions of your log file to get an 
indication of what could go wrong, but most likely - because 
of the large size of your log file - the connection to your DB is 
not configured correctly

Take a look at this document: 
""openCRX Quick Start
Version 1.6.0""

page 6-7 (pdf version). I have exactly the same                  with what is
shown in it. The only differences are the numbers (probably because the manual
use older version).

While in the browser after some time I can see         the first  page for Admin-root
exactly the same as in the manual too.

I've installed opencrx, JBoss 4.0.2, MySql Server 4.1, on a WIN XP box. JBoss
starts up fine, I can get the opencex login display, but trying to login blows
up. The console shows lots of messages indicating locales and the like are loading,
there are a handful of messages regarding no defalut configuration for openmdx,
then many minutes of stacktrace errors before the display finally says login
error. The beginning of the logs is as follows:

By: mediocre1

Hi, 

I tried to create a user with adminrights.
First I created with admin-Root a principal testAdmin who is member in principal
group Administrators. Then I created with admin-Standard the user testAdmin
with the contact test and primary user group Standard\Administrators. No problems
so far.

Now I logged in with testAdmin and tried to create a new user but I get the
following error when saving:
Status  	
1
Status message 	
[can not create user, reason is OpenCrxDomain.1000: No permission for OBJECT_CREATION
on object]

So the user has probably no admin rights. How can I fix this?

thanks
Marc

Read and respond to this message at:

By: kratib

I put the following line at the head of the verifyObject function:

AppLog.warning(""[OCVCM] Verifying object "", object.path().toString());

I created a new account, then invoked the Action > Create Lead... from the new
account. I was surprised to find the following log:

AppLog|2005-06-06

Which means verifyObject is called twice on the new account, and not once on
the new lead. Does this make sense?

there is only limited support for searching/filtering of code 
fields at this time:
- exact match based numerical value (as you already figured 
out)
- comparisons based on numerical values, e.g. >1
- exact match based on string value of code, e.g. T1 
(openCRX)  

it would be possible to support additional searches, but they 
are not implemented yet

The other issue you mention is a bug. Apparently, there are 
unhandled exceptions if ""bad / illegal / not supported"" 
searches are launched; this is the reason why your users 
end up on the homepage (the user home is kind of a default 
page being displayed).

Have any of you tried to prune OpenCRX a little? I mean, say i'd like to use
just some features of the System, so farewell the others. I've started just
deleting things from the model, but after generating everything, the ""removed""
stuff is still there. And the ObjectInspectorServlet -among others- naturally
complains about missing stuff.

Any suggestions?

The German user manual (""Handbuch"") is very detailed and

the Quick Start guide explains how you can disable providers (e.g. because you
do not need them) and the customizing guide explains how you can disable attributes,
etc.

randomly removing classes, references, etc from the model is not a good idea

Is it possible to configure ebXML with opencrx, so that we can export data in

if an XSL transformation does not do the trick, you always have the option of
extending openCRX with an ebXML exporter that does exactly what you want it
to do (btw, the XML exporter has been much enhanced since openCRX v1.4.0...)

"[opencrx - Open Discussion] RE: Slowliness","
Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3192442
By: ramon_turnes

I would like to contribute to this discussion with the following  performance
testing.

OpenCRX performance and overload testing has been executed on the following
configuration:

-          Pentium IV, 3GHz, 1GB ram

-          JBoss 4.0

-          PostgreSQL 8.0 (initial database)

-          MS SQL 2000 (additional database)

 

In OpenCRX database 10.000 contacts were inserted, each with the following
attributes:

-          name (all contacts have different name)

-          surname (groups of 10 contacts have the same surname)

-          accountState ( cyclic rotation through all possible values)

-          accountType (same as above)

-          accountRating (same as above)

 

 

Measured was application response to user input in seconds.

User input actions:

-          adding new contact

-          adding new lead and new opportunity

-          adding new activity

-          searching trough contacts

-          search based on contact attributes (state, type and rating)

 

MS SQL 2000

Same tests as with PostgreSQL database were performed. Response time with 10000
contacts was not noticeably slower than with 10 contacts and was around 1 second
when user actions involved contacts. Even with two users logged in, response
time remained almost the same and was around 2 seconds (both users searched
through contacts).

 

PostgreSQL database

Tests showed that response time is slow, when user actions involve contacts
(listing, searching) and is good otherwise. With 10000 contacts response time
when contacts were involved is on average around 3 seconds. We got the same
results with 900 contacts in database.

When more users connect to OpenCRX simultaneously, response time drops even
further. With 2 users logged in and both searching through contacts, response
time was around 7-8 seconds.

It is true that the contacts are not real contacts and that they have been generated.

Thanks for your immediate reply.
From your explaination, it is clear that, we can configure ebxml with opencrx.
Can you please give me the way for this. I have to bring the result of export
in ebxml instead of xml.

Thanks

Yes, i know I can disable providers and hide GUI components.
I was just wondering whether more radical prunes are possible. And obviously,
I'm not cutting ramdom classes off... just the ones I really don't think will
be needing in the foreseeable future.

There are two ways to 'remove' models:
a) remove the models from the model repository (rose .cat files). 
b) prevent the models from loading at runtime. Remove the model names from the
deployment descriptors: web.xml,
ear\opencrx-core-CRX-App.ear\kernel.jar\META-INF\ejb-jar.xml,
ear\opencrx-core-CRX-App.ear\ui.jar\META-INF\ejb-jar.xml. Models are configured
with the option 'modelPackage'.

Some models depend on each other. If you remove models which are required by
other models you will get exceptions. In case
a) when exporting the models (ant build)
b) during application deployment

A user can have one or more principals, but not vice versa as you have tried
it. A principal corresponds to a login, so if you are on the login screen, you
always enter a principal name. Each principal has a corresponding homepage,
which is shown after successful login. Because a user can have multiple principals,
he can also have multiple homepages and therefore user settings.

Answering my own question:
The code in Contracts::createOpportunity contains a bug in openCRX 1.6.0. This
method calls OpenCrxKernel_1::cloneObject to create a new opportunity out of
the given lead, then passes the new opportunity to OpenCrxKernel_1::assignToMe.
However, by that time, the new opportunity object has *already* been persisted
(in OpenCrxKernel_1::cloneObject via a call to RequestCollection::addCreateRequest).
In order to further modify it and save those modifications, we have to first
call OpenCrxKernel_1::retrieveObjectForModification. This method stores objects
to be modified until OpenCrxKernel_1::epilog is called to flush them.

So just adding the line

DataproviderObject opportunity2
= this.plugin.retrieveObjectForModification(opportunity.path());

right before calling assignToMe and passing opportunity2 instead of opportunity
will solve the bug. This applies to all Contracts::createXXX methods. I spent
10 days figuring that one out ;-)

neither ... nor ...

looks like the modeling of ""relationships"" between contracts and activities
requires a review; currently, an activity can (optionally) point to a contract,
and to a contract you can attach (0..n) references to activities (this information
is NOT derived which is why you don't automatically see the respective activity
once the reference to the contract is set)

activity1 was reviewed for openCRX v1.6, we plan to review contract1 for openCRX
v1.7

thank you for your feedback

if this is a one-time import you might want to create a schema-compliant XML
file and then import this file

I'm trying to run the demo client, but it fails for me. I'm unpacking the opencrx
and openmdx distributions (untaring openmdx core and security under
opencrx-1.6.1/opt).

First I do an ""ant config"" for openmdx. After this, I go to opencrx-1.6.1 and
try ""ant install-src"".

The next step is this (and you can see the output):

dape@mymachine:/tmp/opencrx-1.6.1/core$ ant -Dsimple.client.name=Guest

yes. it is a one time import... then only new records have to be added.

Do ou have any guide on how to create this schema-compliant XML file?

no (creating XML files is not an openCRX-specific issue) - hook up with somebody
who is familiar with XML

"[opencrx - Help] Can't start a transaction client side","
Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3200661
By: dape

I'm trying to write a client which inserts a legal entity in OpenCRX. To do
it, I modified the SimpleClient example to open a transaction and create a legal
entity with a name. The code to do it is:

            // get account segment
            org.opencrx.kernel.account1.cci.Segment accountSegment
= (org.opencrx.kernel.account1.cci.Segment)rootPkg.refObject(
""xri:@openmdx:org.opencrx.kernel.account1/provider/CRX/segment/Standard"");
            
	    LegalEntityClass legalEntityClass = account1Pkg.getLegalEntityClass();
	    account1Pkg.refBegin();
	    LegalEntity entity = legalEntityClass.createLegalEntity();
	    entity.setName(""Test company from my client"");
	    account1Pkg.refCommit();

The configuration is the same that does work for me in the original SimpleClient
example. But now it breaks and returns this stack trace. I modified the ra.xml
in the ear to set transaction-support to LocalTransaction but it still does
not work. Any help?

This is a bug in ClientHelper.createObjectFactory(). The connection should be
created as follows:

            new Connection_1(
                provider,
                false,
                null
            )

The second parameter must be false instead of true. This creates a
non-container-managed connection.

Yes.

For development you typically use Tomcat/LightweightContainer/Eclipse as described
in the openMDX QuickStart guide (see
http://www.openmdx.org/openmdx/core/1.7/QuickStart/htmlsingle/QuickStart.html).
You can configure Tomcat to run on any port.

For the test environment use JBoss as described in the openCRX installation
guide for JBoss.

You can also write an openCRX client in Java which reads the data from the mySQL
db and stores the data in openCRX. Have a look a the sample openCRX client
org.opencrx.demo.kernel.SimpleClient.

Ok, it did work for me. But it does not update the server. Referring again to
the code:

	    LegalEntityClass legalEntityClass = account1Pkg.getLegalEntityClass(); 
	    account1Pkg.refBegin(); 
	    LegalEntity entity = legalEntityClass.createLegalEntity(); 
	    entity.setName(""Test company from my client""); 
	    account1Pkg.refCommit(); 

I'm trying to create a test legal entity. It's not added to the PostgreSQL database
and it cannot be accessed through the web ui :/ Any clue?

Summary: Clarification on DB connector / initial login issue

Initial Comment:
I too have been having trouble with the initial login
and config.
I too have observed that a 9 MegaByte logfile after the
initial
logfile means the database connection is incorrect.

I'd like to confirm my understanding of how the
database connector
is specified, in order to more effectively debug and to
memorialize
this for others.

Questions:

Is the entire database connection specified in the file,
   
$JBOSSDIR/server/default/deploy/jdbc-opencrx-CRX-postgresql-ds.xml

If so, given the default file:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<datasources>

        <local-tx-datasource>
                <jndi-name>jdbc_opencrx_CRX</jndi-name>
               
<connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost/crx-CRX</connection-url>
               
<driver-class>org.postgresql.Driver</driver-class>
                <user-name>system</user-name>
                <password>password</password>
                <connection-property
name=""loginTimeout"">100</connection-property>
               
<transaction-isolation>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</transaction-isolation>
                <min-pool-size>5</min-pool-size>
                <max-pool-size>100</max-pool-size>
               
<blocking-timeout-millis>5000</blocking-timeout-millis>
               
<idle-timeout-minutes>15</idle-timeout-minutes>
                <new-connection-SQL>SELECT * FROM
kernel_REF</new-connection-SQL>
                <check-valid-connection-SQL>SELECT *
FROM kernel_REF</check-valid-connection-SQL>
        </local-tx-datasource>

</datasources>


Is the database name crx-CRX which is the last token in
the uri 
surrounded by <connection-url>?  If it needs to be
different, does it
need to be changed in other than this file?

Is the postgresql user name is ""system"" in the
<user-name> tag?
If it needs to change, is this the only place it needs
to change?

Likewise for <password>

If I can ""psql crx-crx system"" successfully from the
command line,
using the paramaters in this file, is that sufficient?

Is there another test for db connectivity with more
to-the-point error output?

Thanks!

Eclipse's BIRT is much more promising than JasperReport
or other reporting initiative. It is currently in the
dawn of first 1.0 version, probably this month. So I
recommend BIRT for opencrx roadmap for reporting. It is
more comprehensive, more complete althought it is not
the most ready-to-use. It is easily integrated with
Eclipse and have certain BI functionality definitely
will be materialised.

we reviewed BIRT v1.0 (released on 6-June-2005) and it looks 
promising indeed. Thanks for the pointer.

"[opencrx - Help] RE: Relation contact - legal entity","

By: dape

I'm trying to use this model in OpenCRX 1.6.x. The problem I'm finding is that
I can't reach the legal entity from the organizational unit.

It would be quite useful if I could get the legal entities related to a
organizational unit. Is there any easy way to do this? Now I have to search
an account with the same name of the organizational unit, which adds one or
two more accesses to the web.

Solved. You need to add the created account to the segment. The code is now:

   LegalEntityClass legalEntityClass = account1Pkg.getLegalEntityClass();
   account1Pkg.refBegin();
   LegalEntity entity = (LegalEntity) legalEntityClass.refCreateInstance(null);
   entity.setName(""Test company from my client"");
   accountSegment.addAccount(entity);
   account1Pkg.refCommit();

By the way, I'm doing this technological tests because I'm trying to create
a Java Gtk UI for some use cases of OpenCRX. It's working now :). I have a pretty
little application which asks you a name of the legal entity and inserts it
into OpenCRX. It has been quite easy to deploy a prototype in few development
hours. Congratulations for the work to the development team!

Hi

I am looking at using openCRX for a CRM system for a client.

They are a property rental company.

They also wish to have a website which shows the properties. I am wondering
how easy it would be to access OpenCRX's database to diplay the property details
on the seperate marketing website?

At the same time i was wondering how acheivable it is to have basic queries
on the marketing website to feed into OpenCRX automatically?

The third question would be is it possible for OpenCRX to be set to auto email
customers at set times based on certain triggers?

Thanks

Edd

you will need descriptors to deploy openCRX on JRun4 and various Java classes
programmed against the API of JRun4, i.e. it's not just a matter of deploying
openCRX

So, there is no way I can install/deploy opeCRX similar way to the manual on
Websphere/JBoss/Weblogic.
What are APIs of JRun 4 I need to modify???
Can openMDX and openCRX be in the same Application server directory?

I see that the offline /mobile support is planned in

its planned for v1.7.

While it may be a matter of months between the 2

management and get their buy-in on the product.
Everything else seems fine, but the decision hinges on
this. Apparently, not all traveling salespeople have
access to internet all the time, and dependence on the

something they are uneasy with.

Can someone tell me when exactly (which month) we can

Mobile support is currently planned for openCRX v1.8, but I 
must add that this is not cast in stone. We publish the 
openCRX roadmap to indicate to the community in what 
direction we intend to take openCRX, but the roadmap is 
always subject to change. The main reason being that 
paid ""feature accelerations"" (an important source of financing 
for the openCRX project!) have higher priority than 
unsponsored features; openCRX team members work on the 
latter in their free time. All features (including paid feature 
accelerations) are included in the Open Source version of 
openCRX.

If you (or your management) require a particular ""quality of 
service"" (e.g. a feature delivered on a certain date) you 
should contact the openCRX team. The workings of the 
openCRX project are shown at 
http://www.opencrx.org/support.htm#DevSupport

Regarding your question: as of today, nobody knows when 
exactly mobile support will be available. The plan is to add 
this feature to openCRX v1.8, but we have openCRX v1.7 still 
ahead of us (and the feature list is very packed: 
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/1.7/new.htm), including 
some crucial features like ""report generation""...

by the root provider only, i.e. to import changed code files you need to connect
to the root provider, login as admin-root, and then set the access levels of
the codes as you did when you initially installed openCRX

Initial Comment:
Hi,

I think this is a great project and I’m trying to follow all 
the changes but the only think that stop me to move to 
this CRM/CRX is the user interface, is not clear for a 
even for a IT person, the interface is a big AXE on the 
improvement of any application more easies is the 
interface more clients/user you will have, and this is my 
point the interface it should be like something like most 
of the users know (from IT person until the secretary) 
that is Outlook.

I’m a Webmaster with strong knowledge and a   
background on usability that is why I’m permit my self 
to ask for an improvement on the user interface.

thank you fro your quick response, I think should use more or 
lees the same interface (similar icons the same 
toolbars/disposition of the menus/etc...) like that it will be 
more intuitive. 

I think it will be great to build this on the Laszlo platform, is 
JUST great!!!! Can you tell me when we can see the first 
stages?

(I love flash and I’m sure that I will be very impress with the

We're working on various improvements and all contributions 
are more than welcome - regarding the default web client you 
just got to keep in mind that this is a fully generic interface 
with a slightly different budget (EUR 15K) than MS Outlook 
2003 (??).

Also, there are efforts under way to develop alternative clients 
(e.g.  based on Laszlo) and if you want to extend MS 
Outlook to access openCRX that should not be too difficult.

Read and respond to this message at:

By: parchegroup

Thank you for your help.

I found the codes for shippingmethod in my case. 

I did the initial setup by Root (setting the access levels) as described in
QuickStart manual.

But I still have no items in my pulldown menues.

I think I have to load the codes for - in my case shipping method - first by
adding a new CodeValueContainer.

If this is right, I don't know how. I didn't find any description about using
and adding codes (CodeValueContainer).

Thx for help.

PS: Sorry for the bad english.

1) the default distribution contains various code values for shipping method
(2 day air, 3 day select, ...), i.e. I do not understand why you do not have
any items in your pulldown list

2) you must add new codes to the root provider (please note that the code file
shippingmethod.xml is contained in the standard EAR as well as in the root EAR
- changing the code file in the standard EAR does not do the trick...)

3) if you extended the model (e.g. created your own class with a code field
for shippingmethod), then you can add that element to the list of items in the
code value field - currently, shippingmethod is mapped to 2 code fiels:
org:opencrx:kernel:contract1:ShippingDetail:shippingMethod and
org:opencrx:kernel:product1:PriceLevel:shippingMethod)

Hi Mr. Mueller,

I have found the codes as you decribed. The accesslevel of them are set to 4
(browse), 2 (update) and 2 (delete).

But I still do not see any of codes in my system (shippingmethod was only an
example).

Perhaps you would like to have a look at the following URL:
http://mail.parche.de/opencrx-core-CRX-Root/
The login-parameter were not changed.

Thank you very much.

I'm wondering if the placement of my application policy entries are causing
my problem - the install doc doesn't indicate where in the default file the
entries should be added, or if it matters.

Also, contrary to the install doc, the program looks for login_config.xml, not
login-config.xml under windows ...

Hi,

Up to now i haven't found anything about this issue in any guide.

In the webpages:
""Starting with openCRX v1.5 you have an additional option to integrating openCRX
with third-party products. This new option is particularly useful if the third-party
product lacks a well-defined API to read/write objects as it is often the case
with legacy systems. If it is easier to directly access the DB than getting
those old-school-programmers to come up with a decent API to access their system
you will love our improved support for updatable user-defined DB objects.""

To OpenCRX developer  team, or to anyone:
what ""updateable user-defined objects"" mean? Do I need to modify the UML model
to use this feature? How far is its flexibility, I mean, with this feature can
I migrate my legacy apps to openCRX easily?

Thanks before any feedback.

In my case I followed the user guide line by line.
And everything work smoothly. Sorry I cannot help to analyze the cause of the
error. I only follow the manual and   it always work. So I guest you may need
to self-check again? Line by line. hmmm....

Summary: initial data loading problem

Initial Comment:
Greetings,

I'm running OpenCRX 1.6 in a Oracle 8 database. I had
it running until I started to have some data problems.
As it is a testing enviroment, we decided to drop the
database and create it again to avoid data corruption.

I followed all the steps to create the database, tables
and views. Everything looked to be fine.

After I started running the application, I could see
the login page as well. The problem started after my
first attempt to login in as root-Standard.

The documentation says that the initial data would be
loaded by the first time that root-Standard log in the
application, but this is not happening: all tables in
the application are empty.

The log file is very big to put it in this message, but
below follows the message that appears several times in
the log file:
---
 BasicException.Entry[0]
   Timestamp=2005-06-28 12:22:00.938
  
Class=org.openmdx.compatibility.base.dataprovider.layer.persistence.jdbc.AbstractDatabase_1
   Method=findReferenceIds
   Line=1312
   ExceptionDomain=DefaultDomain
   ExceptionCode=MEDIA_ACCESS_FAILURE
   Param[0]:
exception.class=org.openmdx.base.exception.ServiceException
   Param[1]: exception.source=apps:server1
---

I don't think so it's a database connection, since I'm
using the same user that the application was using to
drop/recreate the tables and indexed. The JDBC XML
configuration file is the same too.

How can I force the application to reload the initial
configuration to the database? Do I need to install
everything again?

Regards,
Alceu

I reviewed the model of opencrx espeically on class auditee, auditentry,etc.
And I wonder when and how auditentry could be stored in DB for no the trigger-like
found in the functions openmdx supported.
Meanwhile, I couldn't find out where to use the class
org.opencrx.kernel.layer.persistence.Audit_1 which seems to be the key to get
""Audit"" work.

TIA!

"[opencrx - Help] crm & openbsd","
Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3225518
By: rgilaard

Hi folks,

I'm planning to use opencrx crm on my production server. The operating system
of my choice is OpenBSD. However, on this system, apache is run chrooted as
described on their website here:

A chroot(2)ed application is locked into a particular directory and unable to
wander around the rest of the directory tree, and sees that directory as its
""/"" (root) directory. In the case of httpd(8), the program starts, opens its
log files, binds to its TCP ports (though, it doesn't accept data yet), and
reads its configuration. Next, it locks itself into /var/www and drops privileges,
then starts to accept requests. This means all files served and used by Apache
must be in the /var/www directory.

Will this be a problem for using opencrx? (Guess so)

How can I solve these issues?

Brgds

have a look at the requirements to run openCRX, in particular
http://www.opencrx.org/faq.htm#appserverreq

--> Apache is a web server, but you neeed an application server (e.g. JBoss)
to run openCRX

another issue to solve on OpenBSD is Java - you need JDK 1.4 to run openCRX
v1.6.1

if you manage to run openCRX on OpenBSD, please post your configuration; I am
sure there are others interested in running openCRX on this fine OS

Yes. 
 
For development you typically use Tomcat/LightweightContainer/Eclipse as described
in the openMDX QuickStart guide (see
http://www.openmdx.org/openmdx/core/1.7/QuickStart/htmlsingle/QuickStart.html).
You can configure Tomcat to run on any port.
 
For the test environment use JBoss as described in the openCRX installation
guide for JBoss.

1) Applicatioins should access openCRX using the API and NOT access the database
directly. javadoc of the API see
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/1.6/java/index.html
2) What excactly you want to achieve: access openCRX from the marketing website
or access the marketing website from openCRX and present 'marketing website'
data through the openCRX GUI?
3) Have a look at the subscribe/notify feature of openCRX. See
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/1.6/QuickStart/htmlsingle/openCRX_QuickStart.html
#S-SUBSCRIBE-NOTIFY.

I second the motion.  Right now I have a FreeBSD box  but would like to run
on OpenBSD, which brings up another question.  I'd like to run OpenBSD 3.7 on
a platform with a 64-bit AMD processor to take advantage of the W^X security
feature .  Does anyone see a problem running OpenCRX in that environment (other
than the usual recent-enough-Java-on-OpenBSD stuff)?

Readin on through the post I found
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3086960, which says it's a
memory related problem solved by making more RAM available to the virtual
machine.
I am running with JAVA_OPTS: -server -Xms128m -Xmx128m -Dprogram.name=run.sh
-Dorg.openmdx.compatibility.base.application.j2ee.domain=apps
-Dorg.openmdx.compatibility.base.application.j2ee.server=server1
-Djava.protocol.handler.pkgs=org.openmdx.kernel.url.protocol
-Dorg.openmdx.log.config.filename=/opt/jboss/server/default/server.log.properties
-Dmail.SSLSocketFactory.class=org.opencrx.kernel.mail.SendMailSSLSocketFactory

Interestingly enough I can't seem to find any reference to the ""-Xms128m -Xmx128m""
parameters in run.sh. Where do they hide?

Sorry for yet another post to this thread ;)

The ""-server -Xms128m -Xmx128m"" part of JAVA_OPTS is loaded from run.conf in
the same direcroty as run.sh.
I changed the stettings in run.conf to  -Xmx256 which solved the problem of
setting recursive mode.

Hope this helps everybody who has this problem.

the following error: ""Media access failure. Possible 
reasons are: field value too long, database table corrupt 
or invalid, database not available. See log for details: 
20050705T091021.937Z"" I use version 1.6.0 of 
openCRX. Is this a known bug???

"[opencrx - Help] New subjects with existing principals","
Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3234324
By: kratib

I'm trying to create a new user/subject that relatees to an existing principal.
I am under the impression that this is acceptable conceptually in openCRX. I
tried the following steps:

1. Create an account for the new user
2. Go to User Homepages > Actions... > Create User... and choose a new user
ID, Default realm, existing principal name, newly-created account, standard\users
group.

This step answers that the user's homepage has been created but when I login
with the new username, exceptions occur (notably at
org.opencrx.kernel.layer.model.AccessControl_1.assertSecurityContext(AccessContr
ol_1.java:380)

Any idea how to make that work, if at all possible?
TIA,
K.

Initial Comment:
I see that the offline /mobile support is planned in
v1.8 on the roadmap page, while the features page says
its planned for v1.7.

While it may be a matter of months between the 2
releases, this is a crucial fearture to convince
management and get their buy-in on the product.
Everything else seems fine, but the decision hinges on
this. Apparently, not all traveling salespeople have
access to internet all the time, and dependence on the
data in the openCRX database while traveling is
something they are uneasy with.

Can someone tell me when exactly (which month) we can
expect  to see this feature?

Thanks in advance

Hi sachin,
what information do the salespeople need offline access to?
If you do not need complete offline access, we can provide
you with basic data synchronization features. However, if
your organization requires complete access to openCRX when
offline, our sync platform is not the best alternative.

By default, our platform supports synchronization of basic
PIM data between openCRX and Outlook or SyncML compliant
clients. If synchronization of a limited number of
additional objects are required, we may customize the
solution to fit your needs.

Please feel free to contact me at erik@monator.com

Mobile support is currently planned for openCRX v1.8, but I 
must add that this is not cast in stone. We publish the 
openCRX roadmap to indicate to the community in what 
direction we intend to take openCRX, but the roadmap is 
always subject to change. The main reason being that 
paid ""feature accelerations"" (an important source of financing 
for the openCRX project!) have higher priority than 
unsponsored features; openCRX team members work on the 
latter in their free time. All features (including paid feature 
accelerations) are included in the Open Source version of 
openCRX.

If you (or your management) require a particular ""quality of 
service"" (e.g. a feature delivered on a certain date) you 
should contact the openCRX team. The workings of the 
openCRX project are shown at 
http://www.opencrx.org/support.htm#DevSupport

Regarding your question: as of today, nobody knows when 
exactly mobile support will be available. The plan is to add 
this feature to openCRX v1.8, but we have openCRX v1.7 still 
ahead of us (and the feature list is very packed: 
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/1.7/new.htm), including 
some crucial features like ""report generation""...

hi,

just a simple question for my understanding: Why is it not possible in opencrx
to define an address (email, postal etc.) for an organization? does this make
sense?

You cannot add addresses to organizations because an Organization is a container
for a complete organizational structure (i.e. it makes sense that you cannot
add addresses). You cannot add addresses to OrganizationUnits because this feature
is available in the model (here one could imagine that extending the model might
be useful). However, as you can ""add"" Contacts (with addresses) to OrganizationUnits
and let LegalEntities (also with addresses) point to OrganizationalUnits, you
might get quite far without being able to add addresses to OrganizationUnits
directly...

Hi, 
What a great tool, it's just amazing!

I've been playing around with opencrx 1.6, but  i had no success in adding product

Does anyone knows how can i do it ?

"[opencrx - Help] RE: How to add new product types ?","
Read and respond to this message at: 
https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=3251554
By: crixpcmu

Product types can be defined in a code table. The distribution does not include
such a code table, i.e. it is up to you to create one. Have a look at the file
""emailtype.xml"" for an example. With the following steps you can easily create
a code table for product types:

-  make a copy of the file emailtype.xml and name it producttype.xml
- open the file producttype.xml in any UTF-8 capable editor 
- change the name of the CodeValueContainer from emailType to productType
- the <_item>-Entry for productType is
  org:opencrx:kernel:product1:Product:productType
- change/add Code Value Entries to your liking
- save the file producttype.xml
- finally, you need to remove the <_item>-Entry for productType from the file
""catchallundefined.xml""

Please note that code files are imported by the root provider (i.e. it is not
sufficient to make these changes for the standard provider only). After importing
the new codes you will have to set the access levels (refer to the QuickStart
guide as the procedure is the same as it was during installation).

openCRX v1.6.1 can only handle ""work records""; extending this concept (e.g.
to include expenses, etc.) is on the roadmap. For the time being you could probably
""abuse"" the work record concept to keep track of your expenses.

A precondition to properly handling expenses is a decent booking engine - we
will soon deliver one with openCRX v1.7.0.
