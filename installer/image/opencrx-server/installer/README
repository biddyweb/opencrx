Welcome to openCRX!
-------------------

This installer has created an openCRX instance running on
Apache TomEE (see http://openejb.apache.org/3.0/apache-tomee.html) 
and HSQLDB. The installation comes with TomEE and a preconfigured database.

You can start and stop openCRX using the corresponding shortcuts
on the desktop created by the installer. After starting openCRX

http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-core-CRX

The following accounts are pre-configured (UserId / Password):

* Open an command shell
* cd to ${installdir}/bin
* Start openCRX with opencrx.bat START in Windows platforms
  and ./opencrx.sh START in Linux platforms
* Check the console output for errors

WorkflowController
