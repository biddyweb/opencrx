Welcome to openCRX!
-------------------

This installer has created an openCRX instance running on
Tomcat 6 extended by Apache OpenEJB and HSQLDB 1. The installation 
comes with a preconfigured database. It contains data which is 
created when working through the openCRX quick start guide (see
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/2.5/tomcat-6/openCRX_Installation_Tomcat-6.html).

You can start and stop openCRX using the corresponding shortcuts
on the desktop by the installer. After starting openCRX you can
login using a browser. Valid URLs are:

* openCRX/Core: http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-core-CRX
* openCRX/Store: http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-store-CRX/Store.jsp

The following accounts are preconfigured:
* guest
* admin-Standard
* admin-Root
The password for all three accounts is 'opencrx'.

Troubleshooting
---------------
When you are not able to login then try the following:

* Open an command shell
* cd to ${installdir}/bin
* Start openCRX with opencrx.bat START in Windows platforms
  and ./opencrx.sh START in Linux platforms
* Check the console output for errors

WorkflowController
------------------
Here is how to start the workflow controller:

* Login as admin-Root
* Select Administration then the menu entry
  Wizards > openCRX Workflow Controller.
* This activates and opens the WorkflowController servlet.
  'Turn on' / 'Turn off' allows to activate and deactivate
  openCRX background services.

Configure your own database
---------------------------
If you want to use another database system than HSQLDB or if you
want to use another existing database do the following:
* Adapt the datasource definition for jdbc_opencrx_CRX
  to match your database settings. 
* If not already present, copy the required JDBC driver to
  ${installdir}/apache-tomcat-6/lib.
