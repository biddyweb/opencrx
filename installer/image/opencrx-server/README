Welcome to openCRX!
-------------------

This installer has created an openCRX instance running on 
Tomcat 6 (extended by the openMDX Lightweight EJB Container) 
and MySQL 5. The installation comes with a preconfigured MySQL 
database. It contains data which is created when working 
through the openCRX quick start guide (see 
http://www.opencrx.org/opencrx/1.11/QuickStart/openCRX_quickstart.html).

You can start and stop openCRX using the corresponding shortcuts
on the desktop by the installer. After starting openCRX you can 
login using a browser. Valid URLs are:

* openCRX/Core: http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-core-CRX 
* openCRX/Store: http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-store-CRX/Store.jsp
* openCRX/Wiki: http://localhost:<tomcat_port>/opencrx-wiki-CRX/

The following accounts are preconfigured:
* guest
* admin-Standard
* admin-Root
The password for all three accounts is 'opencrx'.

Troubleshooting
---------------
When you are not able to login then try the following:

* Open an command shell
* cd to ${installdir}/bin
* Start openCRX with control.bat START in Windows platforms
  and ./control.sh START in Linux platforms
* Check the console output for errors

WorkflowController
------------------
Here is how to start the workflow controller:

* Login as admin-Root
* Select Administration then the menu entry
  Wizards > openCRX Workflow Controller.
* This activates and opens the WorkflowController servlet. 
  'Turn on' / 'Turn off' allows to activate and deactivate
  openCRX background services.

Configure your own database
---------------------------
If you want to use another database system than MySQL or if you 
want to use another existing database instance you can configure
the database connector as follows:

* Copy the connector which matches your database from the 
  directory ${installdir}/connector to 
  ${installdir}/apache-tomcat-6/deployment-units. 
* Remove the unused connector directory in 
  ${installdir}/apache-tomcat-6/deployment-units.
* Adapt ra.xml which is located in the connector directory so
  that it matches your database instance.
* Copy the matching JDBC driver to 
  ${installdir}/apache-tomcat-6/lib.
