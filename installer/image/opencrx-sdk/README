Welcome to openCRX SDK!
-----------------------

This installer has created an openCRX development environment.
The SDK contains the sources of the following openCRX projects:

* core: contains the openCRX Core models and functions
* apps: contains openCRX applications such as the openCRX/Store
* test-core: contains openCRX JUnit tests 

Each project contains a build.xml which accepts the following
targets:

* clean: clean the project
* install-src: expand project source files
* deliverables: compile and build JARs
* distribution: compile, build JARs and distribution
* assemble: build assemblies
* config: display the project settings

The installer has performed the following tasks
* ant install-src 
* ant deliverables
* ant assemble 
for each project.

The projects come with Eclipse project files. Run 
'ant distribution' on the project before opening the project
with Eclipse. This generates all required source files.


IMPORTANT:
Make sure to set the environment by running the scripts 
./setenv.bat on Windows or ./setenv.sh on Linux platforms.
